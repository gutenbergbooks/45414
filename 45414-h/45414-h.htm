<p class="first">I have aimed in preparing this work to put into
compact and orderly form a large amount of irrefragable evidence
against the superstitions of the church. I have often felt the need of
such a work for my own use. The matter herewith presented has been
culled from some of the ablest writers living and dead. As a book of
reference I hope it may be a valuable aid to all investigators and
truthseekers. Its running head lines, chapter heads, subheads, and
classified subjects make it a &ldquo;handbook.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="argument">
<p class="first">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%201:1">Gen.
1&nbsp;: 1</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No sooner do we read this sentence than we find our
minds full of perplexing questions. Quite naturally we ask in the
&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; of what? It could not mean in the beginning of
God, for it is supposed that he had no beginning; it could not mean the
beginning of eternity, as that is without commencement or end, and it
could not have been in the beginning of matter as it is eternal. If
then matter is eternal, the story about the creation of the heaven and
the earth is nothing more than a myth&mdash;a childish story that has
come down to us from the dark ages of the remote past.</p>
<p>The indestructibility of matter is the corner-stone of modern
philosophy, and the indestructibility of matter implies its eternal
existence, that is, it never was created and it never will cease to
exist. Theologians have taught for centuries that God created matter
out of nothing. Enlightened people have to smile when they hear these
stories repeated. Some theologians who have discovered the folly of
such empty traditions have tried to reconstruct them by means of new
interpretations. The Rev. De Witt Talmage, of Brooklyn, has discovered
that God created matter out of a piece of omnipotence. This discovery
is important, and may lead to grand results; still there are some
people who doggedly refuse to accept this invention, and maintain that
omnipotence is nothing more than an attribute, and that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>one could
with as much propriety speak of God&rsquo;s creating matter out of
omniscience, or omnipresence.</p>
<p>There are others who do not claim that matter was made out of
nothing, but that it was in a chaotic state, and that at a certain time
(before time was), God formed it into the universe in six days of
creation.</p>
<p>But this explanation does not help us out of our difficulties. For
if God did not create matter out of nothing then it is eternal, and
there could be no such thing as creation, or Creator. There is nothing
in this old story at all, if it proves on examination that the
&ldquo;Creator&rdquo; did not create matter; for in that case matter is
co-eternal with God, and like him, is uncaused. When this old
definition of creation fails the theological superstructure built upon
it totters and falls to the ground. For if the Creator did not
originate the universe from nothing, then matter is eternal, and God is
not omnipotent, is not infinite, is not God. Thus we see that we have
no reason whatever to think that there ever was a beginning to matter,
or that creation of matter is at all thinkable. The words
&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; and &ldquo;creation,&rdquo; as thus used are
without meaning.</p>
<p>It is a marvel how long the mind of man has been subject to this
childish fable. Surely the wise men of the different ages who heard it
perceived its unreasonableness. But the wise men were few and the
unwise were many, and the superstructure built over their heads in the
form of theocracies and theologies, laid upon the foundations of this
myth were too formidable to admit of free thought. The prophets must
prophesy according to the traditions of the fathers. New
interpretations were never welcome in this world. A radical idea is
always a source of pain to the superficial or bigoted mind. And above
all heresy was the worst of all things, and everything new was heresy.
And because human reason was all the time making discoveries which
revealed better things than had been known, and because reason exposed
the weakness and falsity of traditions and superstitions, therefore
reason itself was condemned and put under ban <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>and was
called &ldquo;carnal reason,&rdquo; and in order to overcome it, faith,
blind belief, was set up as the greatest of all human virtues. And so
strong was reason in its persistent attempts to get at the truth, it
became necessary to preach faith all the time and to make salvation in
another world depend upon it. And, as if this was not enough, he was
constantly reminded that the sentence, &ldquo;believe or be
damned&rdquo; did not relate wholly to another world. Damnation often
began in this world. The persecutions, inquisitions, crusades, St.
Bartholomew massacres all show how hard it is with those who have faith
to have kindness of heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God said let there be light and there was light.&rdquo;
But how do we know he said so? Who was the reporter at that early date?
In fact even if it were true, how could any one have ever found it out?
And if any one had found it how could we know it? The same question
might be asked in reference to creation. Who discovered the fact? How
could we know that some one had learned it even if it were true?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God saw the light that it was good.&rdquo; From this
expression, we should infer that he did not know beforehand whether the
light he was about experimentally to originate would be a good thing or
not; but after having spoken it into existence and contemplating it for
a while, he pronounced it good. The approval is spoken of it much after
the manner of men. For instance we see a painter after having put the
finishing touches on his picture step back and with satisfaction look
at it, and say, &ldquo;it is the greatest effort of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God divided the light from the darkness.&rdquo; The
originator of this story had not the slightest idea of the nature of
light. He supposed it to be a substance that could be separated from
darkness, which he also imagined a substance, as white beans may be
separated from black beans.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">In his imagination he probably saw God throwing pieces
and chunks of darkness on one side and rays and beams of light on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>other. It is hard for a man who has been born but
once to understand these things. (&ldquo;Mistakes of Moses,&rdquo;
Ingersoll.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God called the light day, and the darkness he called
night; and the evening and the morning were the first day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bible expounders have found it difficult to reconcile the word
&ldquo;day&rdquo; with the teachings of geology. According to common
chronology the creation of this universe out of nothing took place four
thousand and four years before the birth of Christ, which would make
the universe about six thousand years old. The testimony of geology is
that the formation of this earth as it now is, must have a record of
millions of years. And astronomy demonstrates that there are stars so
far from this earth that it would take an indefinitely long time for
the light from them to reach this earth.</p>
<p>Here then are two witnesses against this story which makes the earth
about six thousand years old. These witnesses cannot be impeached.</p>
<p>What shall be done with the record? Oh, put a new interpretation
upon it. &ldquo;A person who is not a critic,&rdquo; says Huxley,
&ldquo;and is not a Hebrew scholar, can only stand up and admire the
marvelous flexibility of the language which admits of such adverse
interpretations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great expounders who explain the inexplicable things assure us
that the six days of creation spoken of in the book of Genesis do mean
literal days of twenty-four hours, but that the word &ldquo;day&rdquo;
is here used to mean an indefinite period, &ldquo;a great while.&rdquo;
But there are so many, and such great difficulties in the way of our
accepting this explanation that we are forced to reject it.</p>
<p>In the first place the record says &ldquo;days,&rdquo; and says
nothing in connection with the word that would lead us to think the
writer meant anything by the word more than it usually signifies; while
on the other hand all the uses of the word seem to imply that a day in
every instance where <span class="corr" id="xd21e229" title=
"Source: the the">the</span> word is used, means a period of
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Hugh Miller, and an eminent geologist, attempted to reconcile
Genesis with geology, and after a laborous effort <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>to achieve
this end committed suicide. He attempted an impossible task.</p>
<p>There is not the slightest grounds for supposing the writer of
Genesis to mean by the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; anything more than we
mean by the same word. The language, &ldquo;the evening and the morning
were the first day,&rdquo; can admit of but one interpretation, and
that is the duration of twenty-four hours. We shall find that the
writer uses the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; where, by no possible
flexibility of interpretation, can the word mean anything other than
this, and gives no hint that he means anything different in the use of
the word in the latter case from its signification in its previous
use.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And on the seventh day God ended his work which
he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which
he had made. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because
that in it he had rested from all his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever;
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day
he rested and was refreshed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And still another instance may be given to show that the word
&ldquo;day&rdquo; has no double meaning: &ldquo;And God made two great
lights, the greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the
night.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;day&rdquo; obviously means what we mean
by it when we use it in connection with night.</p>
<p>These proofs settle the question of the meaning of the word
&ldquo;day.&rdquo; It means in Genesis just what it means when we use
it. The account given of creation in speaking of &ldquo;days&rdquo;
meant literally twenty-four hours; and geology and astronomy prove such
statements to be childish and foolish. If we should admit that the word
&ldquo;day&rdquo; in this narrative meant millions of years, then the
first Sabbath upon which the Lord rested and was refreshed also meant
millions of years. If this be so then it is safe to infer that he is
still resting. This may in some degree account for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>fact
that the ministers are trying to run the world in his name. For if God
exerts his power over the world to guide and control it according to
his own sovereign will it is nothing less than high handed presumption
if not <span class="corr" id="xd21e252" title=
"Source: rebellous">rebellious</span> usurpation on the part of the
clergy to attempt to take the management out of his hands.</p>
<p>In the second chapter of Genesis, Adam is said to have been made
before the animals were created. After Adam had given names to all the
animals as they passed before him in grand review, there was no
helpmeet found among them for him, and as an afterthought God formed a
woman for him out of a rib. But here was a very long period between the
creation of Adam and Eve. According to the first chapter of Genesis
Adam and Eve were created at the same time, and before the creation of
the animal kingdom, but in the second chapter man was the first
creature made and woman the last. This would make Adam millions of
years older than Eve, if the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; means millions of
years in the first chapter of Genesis.</p>

</div>
<p>According to this writer&rsquo;s ideas heaven and earth were two
flat spheres, upon each of which were vast quantities of water. The
firmament in which were set the sun, moon, and stars was in some way

29</a>.) In all these particulars we recognize the same view as was
entertained by the Greeks, and to a certain extent by the Latins. If it
be objected to the Mosaic account that the view embodied in the word
<i>rakia</i> does not harmonize with strict <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e324" title="Source: philosphical">philosophical</span> truth, the
answer to such an objection is, that the writer describes things as
they appear rather than as they are. (Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abridged
Bible Dictionary,&rdquo; Firmament.)</p>
</div>
<p>One not acquainted with the wonderful flexibility of biblical
interpretation, might conclude after reading this explicit definition
of the <i>rakia</i> that the story of creation was an inspired
revelation, but not true. We ourselves are inclined to this opinion,
and we accept the conclusion that the Mosaic description of the
firmament &ldquo;does not harmonize with strict philosophical truth;
and possibly we shall conclude that all parts of the Mosaic cosmogony
will show that the writer who attempts to give a history of the
beginning of the universe, did nothing more than describe things as
they appeared to his mind&rsquo;s eye, rather than as they actually
were.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass,
and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit, after
his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth, and it was
so.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This was on the third day, and we read that on the fifth day,
&ldquo;God created great whales and every living creature that moveth
which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind.&rdquo; But
in the evolution of life upon this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12"
href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>earth, grasses, trees and plants
do not precede the evolution of marine animals. Here again we come upon
one of those instances where the account given does not harmonize with
strict philosophical truth; but the answer to such objections is that
&ldquo;the writer describes things as they appear rather than as they
are.&rdquo; In modern language we should say he was merely guessing at
the riddle of existence.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And God made two great lights, and the greater
to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night; and he made the stars
also.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The creation of the sun and the moon was on the fourth day. But it
is not made clear how there could have been a morning and an evening of
three previous days, in the absence of the sun. Then again there is no
possible explanation for the existence of vegetation without
sunlight.</p>
<p>Grasses, trees, and plants will not grow without sunlight. And still
another difficulty meets us in the same passage. The writer says God
made two great lights, the greater to rule the day and the lesser to
rule the night. And this also is lacking in harmony with &ldquo;strict
philosophical truth,&rdquo; for there is only one great light; the moon
has no light, but merely reflects the sun&rsquo;s rays. It is true it
seems to be a light, and as &ldquo;the writer describes things as they
appear rather than as they are,&rdquo; we can hold him responsible only
for the revelation he makes as a matter of inspiration and not for its
truth.</p>
<p>Before the sun was created, the writer gives us to understand that
the dry land appeared&mdash;or to put it more definitely, God commanded
saying, &ldquo;Let the dry land appear.&rdquo; But to whom was it to
appear when there was no eye yet created to look upon it, and if there
had been, there was no sunlight, and therefore if the world had been
full of eyes the land would not have appeared! This is a problem. Did
the waters lie on the mountain tops, and refuse to run down to the
valleys, until they were commanded?</p>
<p>For how was it possible for a writer who describes things as they
<i>appear</i>, to attempt to give us a glimpse of things which
certainly could not have <i>appeared</i>, only to a mind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>diseased? But not wishing to appear captious we
will let this pass, only however with the explicit understanding that
the writer, in this case certainly attempted to describe things as they
could not appear.</p>
<p>We find our perplexities increasing as we proceed. Especially when
we attempt to read the stone book of geology in company with the Hebrew
book of Genesis.</p>
<p>Whoever he may have been, and there can be no doubt of the sex of
the writer, as the book everywhere betrays the spirit of the
&ldquo;lord of creation,&rdquo; man, he seems to think that the earth
was created before the sun, when the truth is the earth is the child of
the sun. One could as well speak of a son being older than his father
as to talk of the creation of the sun, after the earth had been
created.</p>
<p>Thus, statement after statement of the story about creation falls
for lack of support&mdash;and like bubbles the airy word pictures burst
at the first touch of science.</p>
<p>What gross ignorance the writer betrays in speaking of the vast
universe. It is nothing; it needs no extended description, five words
are enough to describe the creation of an infinite universe, and hence
to the writer it was quite sufficient to merely say, &ldquo;He made the
stars also.&rdquo; And two of these words are supplied by the
transcribers. As it seemed to this original cosmogonist the work of
getting up a universe was not a matter of very great importance.</p>
<p>We are not disposed to credit this story for the reason that, the
author makes it necessary for God to take five days to create the solar
system, but for the infinite universe beyond, he needed less than one
day. The Mosaic cosmogonist had no soul for astronomy or he would have
seen the necessity of more time in the creation of the starry systems.
We could have no patience with his description if it were not for the
fact of which we are so well assured by Smith&rsquo;s Bible Dictionary,
that he is not giving us matter of fact but is &ldquo;describing things
as they appear rather than as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no sooner do we quit one difficulty than we are beset with
another. In looking over the leaves of the stone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>book of
geology we find fossils of animals which existed untold ages before
man, and as they had eyes there must therefore have been light, the sun
must have existed an indefinitely long period before man.</p>
<p>And last of all on the sixth day late on Saturday afternoon, God
created man in his own image. And as he stepped back and surveyed the
week&rsquo;s work which was before him he pronounced himself satisfied
with it all. Everything was just as he would have it. Everything was
perfect. &ldquo;And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it
was <i>very good</i>.&rdquo; In fact there was not a single thing he
could see a chance to make any improvement on; for it is impossible for
us to think of a perfect creator making an imperfect creature. And if
by any mistake he had made anything not just as it ought to be, and as
he intended, we should think that knowing the fact he would make the
necessary improvement; and if he would not, then we must conclude that
he is not infinitely good. Thus every turn we make in this story drives
us to the conclusion that it is not true, that it is only an ancient
myth. It is the brass of ignorance which has been palmed off upon us
for the gold of truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So God created man in his own image,&rdquo; and yet in the
next breath the writer informs us that after Adam and Eve had eaten of
the forbidden fruit, they became more like God, and if they had been
permitted to eat of the tree of life they would have become still more
like him. But it is hard for one who has not been born again to
understand how Adam and Eve could become more and more like God, when
they were created in his image and pronounced <i>very good</i>.</p>
<p>The command given them was, &ldquo;Ye shall not eat of it, neither
shall ye touch it lest ye die.&rdquo; But the serpent said unto the
woman, &ldquo;Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the
day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as
gods knowing good and evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was just how it turned out. After they had eaten of this
prohibited tree, they became more like the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>gods
than they had been. But we are led to immediately <a id="xd21e393"
name="xd21e393"></a>ask, could they have been made in the first place
like them? And unless they were both counterfeits we cannot imagine how
an image can be improved&mdash;that is, become more of an image.</p>
<p>And the Lord God said, &ldquo;Behold the man has become as one of
us, (just as the serpent had foretold) to know good and evil.&rdquo;
Here is a clear contradiction of terms. And in order to explain the
matter at all satisfactorily to ourselves we have to recur to the
assurance of authority that it is not claimed that the narration is
literal history of fact, but merely the writer&rsquo;s opinions of how
it seemed to him it ought to be.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Behold I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and, every tree which is
the fruit of a tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for
meat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Here is an explicit statement of Adam&rsquo;s right to eat of any
fruit he might find. But in the third chapter of this wonderful book,
we find that there are two trees whose fruit he is prohibited from
eating, &ldquo;Of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
garden, God hath said he shall not eat of it.&rdquo; Then after Adam
and Eve had refreshed themselves from the fruit of the tree of
knowledge, which made them as the gods knowing good and evil, the Lord
God said, &ldquo;Now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the
tree of life and eat and live forever, therefore the Lord sent him
forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was
taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We fail to see any reason for the apparent change of plan in the
mind of the Lord. He first grants Adam and Eve the privilege of eating
any fruit they chose, and afterward prohibited them from eating of the
fruit of two trees, which would have most benefited them. Certainly we
can see no good reason for prohibiting them from acquiring knowledge,
especially of good and evil, since the gods had this sort of knowledge
themselves. In fact we would naturally suppose that the more accurate
man&rsquo;s knowledge of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>good and evil is the better off he
would be; he would certainly be more moral. But let us imagine that it
was not desirable for Adam and Eve to have such knowledge and morality
and thus to resemble so closely the gods themselves, is there any good
reason why they should not have partaken of the fruit of the tree of
life, and thereby lived forever? Why should the fact that they had
become more like the gods be a sufficient reason for preventing them
from sharing in the immortal life? Would not it have been altogether
probable that Adam and Eve would continue to become more and more like
the gods, seeing that they had begun so persistently to acquire the
godlike virtues?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the woman saw the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise,&rdquo; etc. We see that it was wisdom that was prohibited, and
not murder, robbery, or drunkenness. Why was knowledge and wisdom
forbidden to man when these above all things else he needed most? Why
is it that religion has always condemned learning, discoveries,
inventions, reforms, etc.? Knowledge is the forbidden fruit of all the
gardens of the gods. But how could these celestial creators expect to
prevent man from gaining knowledge after they had created him with a
brain to think? To think is to have knowledge, and to have some
knowledge is to thirst for more, and thus it was absolute madness to
create man with a brain and command him not think. As well throw a bird
into the air, and shoot it for flying, or spear a fish for swimming in
the water, as to damn a human being for coming into possession of the
knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The story seems to imply many contradictions which are not
explicitly expressed. For Adam and Eve must have been moral beings to
have understood the supposed commands of God. If they were moral then
they already knew what good and evil was. The way in which this
primitive couple acquired knowledge reminds one of the description of
the creation of the sun. In the first chapter of this wonderful book,
we find light created, and on the fourth day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>afterward the sun is made. This is reversing the
order of cause and effect, as in this effect comes before cause. There
is this explanation, however, that the world was new and had not got
fairly into working order.</p>
<p>In the case of Adam and Eve, we have no such explanation to offer.
We find them from the very first moment, rational beings, and of course
having a knowledge of good and evil; but the historian who gives us the
account, declares that they came into the possession of knowledge not
by virtue of their brains; but because of their eating of certain
fruit. The effect is made to be the cause.</p>
<p>There is only one way out of the dilemma. The writer described
things &ldquo;as they seemed rather than as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so great a man as the Hon. W. E. Gladstone has to betake
himself to specious arguments in attempting to refute the testimony of
science when opposed to Genesis. His logic is kindred to that quoted
from Smith&rsquo;s Bible Dictionary, wherein the writer says of the
author of Genesis that he &ldquo;describes things as they appear,
rather than as they are.&rdquo; Mr. Gladstone in the &ldquo;Order of
Creation,&rdquo; says:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Proceeding, on what I hold to be open ground, to state
my own idea of the key to the meaning of the Mosaic record (Genesis), I
suggest that it was intended to give moral, and not scientific
instruction to those for whom it was written.</p>
</div>
<p>Who was it that &ldquo;intended to give moral, and not scientific
instruction?&rdquo; If it was the author of Genesis who intended it for
only moral instruction, then it cannot be claimed to be a
<i><span class="corr" id="xd21e427" title=
"Source: revleation">revelation</span> from God</i>; but if on the
other hand it was God who intended to give only moral instruction, then
he is responsible for making the author of Genesis record that which is
not true. What a sight for gods and men! To see the ex-premier of
England pettifogging at the bar of Reason for a dying, nay dead
superstition; for certainly Genesis as a revelation is dead so far as
reason and science are concerned.</p>
<p>But this hostility to knowledge instituted in the garden of Eden has
been perpetuated through all the ages. Faith <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>has been
held up as the all-important virtue, as by it the priests could get the
people to believe anything. Somewhere Goethe says, &ldquo;Belief is not
the beginning but the end of knowledge.&rdquo; In the early days of the
church it was found necessary to abandon reason. The world had too many
philosophers who stood prepared to expose the superstitions which set
themselves up with authority. The injunction given to and heeded by
chiefly the low and ignorant was, &ldquo;Do not examine; only believe
and thy faith will make thee blessed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wisdom is a bad
thing in life, foolishness is to be preferred.&rdquo; But this
sentiment was older than that date, for we find in the writings of Paul
the same teaching, &ldquo;If any man among you seemeth to be wise, let
him become a fool that he may be wise.&rdquo; At another time he
insists that, &ldquo;We are fools for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My advice is to eat of the fruit of knowledge, and have your eyes
opened to the truth no matter what it is. It may be that some delusive
Santa Claus may fade away in the distance before your clearer vision.
Let it go. Nothing is so expensive as error. Seek to know the truth,
and struggle to throw off such prejudices as tempt you to fashion truth
to your own intellectual myopia or moral obliquities. Eat and become
more truly a man; eat and become more beautifully a woman.</p>

<p>This writer never visited a menagerie. His knowledge of the habits
of the animal kingdom are as innocent as if he had never sought for
knowledge, had never examined natural history, or else he would have
known that such animals as lions, tigers, and wolves could not feed on
grass. The vultures of the air do not live upon seeds or hay, but must
have fish or flesh. Daniel going into a den of lions fed on hay, would
be about as brave as a milk maid&rsquo;s going into the stall to milk a
cow. We cannot conjecture what state of mind the Mosaic cosmogonist
could have been in when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>he described the lion as a
herbivorous animal. It is so wide a departure from the most common
knowledge of the habits of animals that our confidence in the accuracy
of the historian is greatly shaken.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that if man had not eaten of the forbidden
fruit he would have been immortal. Now the very fact that Adam and Eve
ate at all, proves them to have been mortal. For eating implies a
nutritive system, which means growth, maturity, and decay of the
organism. Death is natural, and not a penalty&mdash;not a curse
pronounced upon the primitive pair for disobedience. They would have
died even if they had partaken of the tree of life.</p>
<p>And in connection with this erroneous idea of the loss of
immortality is another respecting labor. It has been a doctrine taught
by the church that labor is a curse pronounced upon the family of man
in consequence of Adam&rsquo;s transgression, and proof often quoted
is, &ldquo;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the consequence of cherishing an ambition to become more
like the gods. Because he was foolish enough to disobey in the matter
of tasting some tempting fruit which attracted his eye, he and all his
posterity must toil hard to get a mere subsistence, and then go to hell
and roast forever. To an ordinary man this seems rather rough for so
small an offense&mdash;to sweat in this life is bad enough, but to
roast in another is too much, and we utter our righteous protest
against it. And since we now have our choice between hell, hades, sheol
or gehenna I, for one, prefer hades as its temperature is lower.</p>
<p>But this story like many others lacks consistency. For we read that
before Adam transgressed the commandment, &ldquo;The Lord took the man
and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.&rdquo;
This looks like work, and gardeners and farmers would look upon all
such arrangements as work, especially would they thus regard it, if the
garden was large and it was the duty of one person to take the entire
care of it, to that is, do all the work. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>Labor therefore was natural to man and did not come upon him as a
curse. It was not in consequence of his eating prohibited apples that
the necessity of toil was imposed upon him as a curse, but because
mental and physical activity are natural, and he could not exist
without them.</p>
<p>Labor is natural and honorable. The hands and brain of man imply
labor, as necessarily as the lungs imply air, or the gills of the fish
imply water. Man could not exist without it; but the great evil which
has arisen is the abuse of labor. Some have been enabled to get
possession of wealth and thereby have the power to control the laborer
and take such a share out of the profits of his toil as they see fit.
The stronger prey upon the weaker. Our present civilization does not
civilize, because it does not remove this relic of barbarism which
allows the rich to rob the poor of the profits of their labor. The
laborer who produces the wealth of the country is the one who does not
get its benefits. The old form of European civilization which justifies
and aids the rich in becoming richer and making the poor poorer is
beginning to show traces of its existence in this country. And we must
say we cannot see how or when this sort of civilization with gilded top
and rotten base is to come to an end. Surely there is no way out of our
barbarous <span class="corr" id="xd21e458" title=
"Source: degredation">degradation</span> except by the development of
the individual through his intelligence into liberty, morality, and
manhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would name them.&rdquo; Some animals, as the Armadillo, and
Sloth of South America would consume more time in going from South
America to the garden of Eden, than Adam&rsquo;s life covered. And how
could the polar bear and the humming bird of the tropics pass through
the different temperatures to reach the garden of Eden? and how long
could they survive if they were even there, and how could they find
their way back to their former habitats? Did the fish all swim up to
the shore and range themselves in a row to be named? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>We wish to call attention to the grand review of the animals, to
point out the implication that Adam could not find a helpmeet among
them. We read:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And out of the ground the Lord God formed every
beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam
to see what he would name them. And whatsoever Adam called every living
creature that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all the
cattle, to the fowl of the air, to every beast of the field, but for
Adam there was not found an helpmeet for him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Now the very words, &ldquo;was not found,&rdquo; imply that search
was made for a helpmeet, but none could be found. And because none
could be found, therefore the Lord God went immediately to work to make
a woman for him. The Creator threw him into a deep sleep, and while in
that unconscious condition and unable to do or say a thing in his own
defense, the Lord took out a rib, or as Ingersoll says, &ldquo;a
cutlet,&rdquo; while Dr. Talmage insists that God took out Adam&rsquo;s
&ldquo;side&rdquo; and reformed it into a woman, and as the text reads,
&ldquo;Brought her unto the man.&rdquo; Was he not there right on the
spot? Was it necessary for the Lord after taking out the rib to go off
a distance by himself that he might finish the work undisturbed? Unless
something of the kind was necessary we do not see the force of the
sentence, &ldquo;Brought her unto the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greenlanders have a story that relates the creation of woman
from man&rsquo;s thumb. This is significant and much more probable.
There is wisdom in this even if it be regarded as a myth. The bare fact
that woman has always been under man&rsquo;s thumb shows some kinetic
relation. The masculine gender has not been reluctant to manifest a
disposition to preserve the gentler sex in this position. He calls her
by pet names, and bestows compliments upon her, and declares upon the
honor of a despot that there is no name so sacred as mother, and that
there is no virtue so precious as that possessed by woman&mdash;he will
even die for her, but still he prefers to keep her in subjection under
his thumb. Liberty will come to woman when she becomes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>tired of
being a mere plaything, a pet, a favorite slave, and then, and not till
then may she rise into the full dignity of womanhood, and throw off
thumb authority and all allegiance to the legends which give the thumb
its authority. Woman needs again to eat of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil, even if she be driven out of the social garden and
ostracised therefrom with the flaming sword of respectability guarding
the gates against her return. Her first rebellion brought knowledge and
progress to man, and her second rebellion must be against both God and
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not surely
die.&rdquo; Never in the history of snakes was there a match for this
first one. It is highly probable that his snakeship did not have a
protracted existence after this emeute of the garden. In fact we never
hear of him more. Some historians say he changed his name and went
west, and some have gone so far as to say that Satan, who attacked Job
many centuries after the seduction of Adam and Eve was nothing more
than the old Serpent under a new name.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, and that is, that the snake in the garden of
Eden immortalized himself in a short time. But we can hardly comprehend
the curse pronounced upon it for so laudable a work. This was the
curse: &ldquo;Above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
thy life.&rdquo; It would seem from this, that the serpent did not go
naturally upon his belly, but some how or other he diddled along on the
tip end of his tail. We fail to see any reason for this sort of
locomotion unless it was to help him look out for other snakes. And we
are perplexed to understand why he should be sentenced to eat dust. If
he was cursed, it seems that the curse is quite conveniently borne by
him; for he finds it just to his gait to go upon his belly, and as for
eating dust, he never did and never will. He is defiant, rebellious,
and successful.</p>
<p>The more we study the character of this original snake the more we
find to admire in him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is true we do not always understand just how things could happen
as they did, but we take them as they read and make the best of them.
For instance we can form no idea of how it was possible for the serpent
to talk to Eve, and reason with her like a philosopher. He talked to
her the same as if he had had vocal organs, and a brain similar but
superior to man&rsquo;s. Unless he had a mouth and head like a human
being we cannot see how he could have talked; and if his head was of
that type we cannot see how he could have been called a snake. There
was a great many suggestions prompted by reading the account of this
wonderful serpent. We cannot understand why he should have been made.
Or why, if it were necessary to have him, he was not placed under some
restraint? Why was he not created so that God himself could govern him?
Or why after seeing he had made him a little too wise, and a trifle too
devilish he did not kill him? Or if that were impracticable or
impossible, why did he not put up signs on all the fences around Eden,
&ldquo;Adam and Eve beware of snakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the
Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto
Adam and said unto him, where art thou?&rdquo; But we are amazed at the
very thought that it was possible for them to get out of sight of the
omniscient eye! We read in many books, and have heard it all our lives
that God sees all things, but according to this account, his first
creatures, fresh from his plastic hands, and very near to him got
beyond his omniscient sight. How could this be, when &ldquo;the eyes of
the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;For his eyes are upon the ways of man and he
seeth all his goings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole
earth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And yet, notwithstanding he made all things, and sees all things,
and knows all things, Adam and Eve were able to get behind the trees
and hide away out of his sight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"
href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>On another occasion it is recorded that the Lord had come down from
heaven to see whether the reports which were brought up to him were
true or not. &ldquo;And the Lord came down to see the city and the
tower which the children of men builded.&rdquo; And in still another
place it is written: &ldquo;And the Lord said because of the city of
Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is grievous I will go
down now and see whether they have done according to the cry of it,
which is come up before me, and if not I will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet other equally inspired writers, describing things as they
appeared rather than as they are, solemnly declare that &ldquo;all
things are naked and open to him with whom we have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we pass on leaving Adam behind the tree, hid away from the
presence of the Lord, to notice other sacred passages which are not in
harmony with strict philosophical truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow;
in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to
thy husband and he shall rule over thee.&rdquo; Now there is no reason
to suppose that the pain of childbirth has ever been increased in
woman. Her physiological structure has in no way undergone a radical
change. Besides, all animals bearing offspring bear pains. Did the
curse upon woman extend to the females of animals bearing offspring?
But wherein does the male suffer his share in this divine
punishment?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he shall rule over thee.&rdquo; This is a matter of
fact&mdash;and is equally true of those people who know nothing of
Israel or Israel&rsquo;s god. Man has ruled over woman in all times and
in all countries, and will continue to reign over her until she aspires
to and contends for her rights.</p>
<p>The path of woman&rsquo;s future is steep, slippery, and long. Many
ages will pass before she attains the glory and beauty possible to
womanhood, but with prophetic eyes we see that time coming. With joy we
labor and wait, that at some future day this world will be made happy
and grand through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>the evolution of truth, love, and liberty in
the elevation of woman.</p>
<p>Another part of the curse is that, &ldquo;Thorns and thistles shall
it (the ground) bring forth,&rdquo; but geology shows that thorns and
thistles were as plentiful in the primeval world as they are now. Hence
there must be some mistake on the part of the writer in setting down
the origin of thorns and thistles for that particular date.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And Adam called his wife Eve because she was
the mother of all living.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This is another astonishing statement. Eve was the mother of all
(human beings) living, and there were none living but herself and Adam!
If she was the mother of all living, she was not only Adam&rsquo;s
mother, but her own mother too.</p>
<p>It is true that when Cain grew to manhood and slew his brother,
there were some people down in the land of Nod, but <span class="corr"
id="xd21e522" title="Source: what">when</span> God made them we have no
means of knowing. They were not a people of much consequence as no
notice is taken of them by our author, and besides they permitted Cain
to come and live among them and take a wife. Perhaps these people were
before Adam and Eve, for it is stated that in the city there were
workers of iron and brass. Brass is a compound of copper and zinc, and
these workers must have had a knowledge of the arts of mining and
compounding metals. The mark, too, was set upon Cain that
&ldquo;whosoever&rdquo; might not slay him; then there must have been a
&ldquo;whosoever.&rdquo; It is very likely that if Cain built a city he
must have had the aid of carpenters and workmen, and it may be that he
found his wife in the land of Nod among the &ldquo;whosoever&rdquo;
&ldquo;workers in of iron and brass.&rdquo; I think the clergy will
agree that there was a &ldquo;whosoever.&rdquo; It would have been
needless to put a mark on Cain to preserve his life from a
&ldquo;whosoever&rdquo; if there were no &ldquo;whosoever,&rdquo; and
my opinion is that Mr. Cain married some of the daughters of Mr.
&ldquo;Whosoever&rdquo; in the land of Nod. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And Adam called his wife Eve because she was the mother of
all living!&rdquo; That eclipses everything. And we were about
concluding that nothing of the kind had ever been known before, but we
remember the story about Ahaziah, and that he was two years older than
his father.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Thirty and two years old was he (Jehoram) when he
began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign. (Kings
8&nbsp;: 17, 24, 26.)</p>
</div>
<p>In the book of Chronicles we have another account.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Thirty and two years old was he (Jehoram) when he
began to reign and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. And the
inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his
stead. Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign.

</div>
<p>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he came to the throne, and he
reigned eight years, which made him forty years old at his death, and
his son Ahaziah who took up the reins of government which dropped from
the hands of his father, was forty-two years old&mdash;just two years
older than his father, and the youngest son at that.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God
make coats of skins and clothed them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There is no description of the style of these dresses, and we are
left without data for judging of their fitness, only we are inclined to
the opinion that the country where it was just the temperature for the
natives to go naked, skin coats would be a trifle too winterish in
style. We fail too see the necessity for such heavy clothing, or in
fact for any clothing at all, inasmuch as they were created to go
naked. For we read that, &ldquo;They were both naked the man and his
wife, and were not ashamed.&rdquo; Or if they must have some protection
for their modesty why were not fig-leaf aprons quite sufficient for
that climate? And still further we can see no necessity for the Lord to
turn tailor and make their clothes when Adam and Eve had already
learned to sew; for &ldquo;they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>sewed fig-leaves together and
made themselves aprons,&rdquo; and as the seasons changed they could
easily have learned to make garments of comfort for themselves, and
also to set the fashions for the rest of the world. The origin of the
universe is an insoluble mystery. And yet to the uninformed mind it
seems to be no problem at all. We daily hear such people reasoning in
this way: &ldquo;There must have been a First Cause of all things, and
that First Cause we call God.&rdquo; It is only because the mind of man
is uninformed, that he reasons in this way. It requires only a little
reflection to see that there could have been no First Cause. It is
clear that every cause must have an effect, for unless it produces an
effect it cannot be a cause. Hence we cannot infer that there can be an
effect which of itself does not become a cause, producing other
effects, so that it is absolutely impossible in the nature of cause and
effect, for a last cause or a first cause to exist. As a last cause
would be a cause only when it produced an effect, and the last effect
would be an effect only when it became a cause. It is equally true that
there could be no First Cause; for whatever is, is the result of some
previous cause. We can view causation only as a chain in form of a
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we apply to this question the notion of <i>time</i> we see
the limit of our thought, because if we try to think of an absolute
creative power <i>before</i> creation, we discover that the idea is
unthinkable, as infinite and absolute creative power in the presence of
inactivity and nothing are incompatible. It could not have been
creative power without creating something. We are therefore unable to
think of absolute creative power as inert&mdash;we are equally unable
to think of it inactive in the presence of chaos, and as impotent to
conceive of its existence as absolute. We cannot think of it existing
<i>after</i> creation, as rest and inactivity are again incompatible
with the notion of force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may look at this subject in whatever way we choose we shall find
that in no way whatever can we form any idea of a First Cause, an
infinite and absolute Creator. Let us <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>see. &ldquo;The First
Cause cannot be absolute, that is, it cannot exist out of all relation
to the universe. Whereas a cause not only sustains some relation to its
effect, but exists as a cause only by virtue of such relations.
Suppress the effect and the cause has ceased to be a cause. Absolute
cause, therefore, is like the phrase, circular triangle. The two words
stand for conceptions which cannot be made to unite. We attempt, says
Mr. Mansel, to escape from this apparent contradiction by introducing
the succession of time. The absolute exists first by itself and
afterward becomes a cause. But here we are checked by the third
conception of the infinite. How can the infinite become that which it
has not from the first.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fisk&rsquo;s Cosmic
Philos<span class="corr" id="xd21e574" title=
"Source: ,.">.</span>&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Look at it whatever way we may the finite mind cannot grasp the
conception of the infinite. Nay, cannot know of the existence of the
infinite. Hence all efforts to explain the First Cause, the absolute,
and the infinite, are more artificial and unreal than painted ships
upon a painted sea.</p>
<p>We may view the subject in still another light. If God reasons, his
knowledge is limited and he is finite. Man reasons because his
knowledge is circumscribed. If he knew everything he would have no
doubts, and hence would not need to investigate, experiment, recollect,
and compare. He would not be compelled to lay down certain definite
data, and follow their implications through rules of logic, and through
scientific experiment in order to reach conclusions. The end would be
as clearly before his mind as the beginning; in fact there would be to
such a mind no beginning and no end. But we cannot imagine an infinite
being who needs to recollect past events. But if we deny that in the
mind of God there is the faculty of memory, we thereby deny that he
reasons. The same may be said of doubt, for if the mind of God is never
troubled with doubts, it is simply because he does not reason. Much of
the mind&rsquo;s activity is employed in doubts. Doubt and inquiry are
necessary elements of thought. Does God doubt? Does he investigate,
compare, and test matters by experiment? If he does then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>he is
not infinite, and if he does not, then he does not reason. Has he
imagination? If he exercises this important function of the mind then
he deals in unrealities, idealizes, has dreams, cherishes visions,
builds air castles. If he does not thus exercise imagination he cannot
be said to reason.</p>
<p>It is an old argument that design implies a designer. The essential
weakness of this argument lies in what is called &ldquo;proofs of
design.&rdquo; And in support of this idea it is commonly urged that
there are everywhere apparent in nature evidences of order, harmony,
and adaptation. But to put this argument into a sentence, the maggot in
the cheese could offer the same arguments to show there was a design in
his position in the cheese. He could argue that everything about him
showed order, harmony, and adaptation. It was just the cheese for
him.</p>
<p>But even if we should admit this statement, it would not prove the
existence of God, for if an intelligent mind had created the universe,
it is certain that that mind itself must have been governed by law
which yields to order, harmony, and adaptation, and if these imply a
designer in one case they must also in the other, and therefore every
designer must have had a designer.</p>

<h2 class="main">PROPHECY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;A <i>prophecy</i>, in the ordinary acceptation
of the term, signifies a prediction of future events, which could not
have been foreseen by human sagacity, and the knowledge of which was
supernaturally communicated to the prophet. It is clear, therefore,
that in order to establish the claim of anticipatory statement,
promise, or denunciation, to the rank of a prophecy, four points must
be ascertained with <i>precision</i>; namely, (1.) what the event was
to which the alleged prediction was intended to refer; (2.) that the
prediction was uttered <i>in specific, not vague, language</i> before
the event; (3.) that the event took place specifically, not loosely, as
predicted; (4.) and that it could not have been foreseen by human
sagacity. * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probably not too much to affirm that we have no
instance in the prophetical books of the Old Testament of a prediction,
in the case of which we possess, at once and combined, clear and
unsuspicious proof of the date, the precise event predicted, the exact
circumstances of the event, and the inability of human sagacity to
foresee it.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e685" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The state of the case appears to be this:
That all the Old Testament prophesies have been <i>assumed</i> to be
genuine inspired predictions; and, when falsified <i>in their obvious
meaning and received interpretation</i>, by the event, have received
immediately a new interpretation, and been supposed to <i>refer to some
other event</i>. When the result has disappointed expectation, the
conclusion has been, not that the prophecy was false, but the
interpretation was erroneous. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>It is obvious that a mode of
reasoning like this is peculiar to theological inquirers. * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;In justification of this idea of a double sense, he (Dr.
Arnold) continues: &lsquo;The notion of a double sense in prophecy has
been treated by some persons with contempt. Yet it may be said that it
is almost necessarily involved in the idea of prophecy. Every prophecy
has according to the very definition of the word, a double source; it
has, if I may venture so to speak, two authors, the one human, the
other divine.... If uttered by the tongue of man, it must also, unless
we suppose him to be a mere instrument (in the same sense as a flute or
a harp), be colored by his own mind. The prophet expresses in words
certain truths conveyed to his mind; but his mind does not fully
embrace them, nor can it; for how can man fully comprehend the mind of
God? Every man lives in time, and belongs to time; the present must be
to him clearer than the future.... But with God there is no past, nor
future; every truth is present to him in all its extent, so that his
expression, if I may so speak, differs essentially from that which can
be <i>comprehended</i> by the mind, or uttered by the tongue of man.
Thus every prophecy as uttered by man (that is, by an intelligent and
not a mere mechanical instrument), and at the same time as inspired by
God, must, so far as appears, have a double sense; one, <i>the sense
entertained by the human mind of the writer; the other, the sense
infused into it by God</i>.&rsquo; We must confess our amazement at the
obvious and extreme unsoundness of this whole passage. Not only does it
painfully remind us of the double meaning so often and so justly
charged upon the Pagan oracles&mdash;but it assumes the strange and
contradictory improbabilities: <i>first</i>, that God was unable to
convey his meaning to the mind of the prophet; <i>secondly</i>, that he
infused this meaning into the words which were uttered, although he
could not infuse it into the mind of the man who uttered them; and
<i>thirdly</i>, that <i>we</i> can see further into the mind and
meaning of God than those to whom he spoke; that they in expressing the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>ideas which he had put into their minds, mistook
or imperfectly conceived those ideas,&mdash;but that to us is given to
discover a thought which those words contained, but did not express, or
which, if they did express it, they were not understood by the writer
to express. Now, either the ideas which God wished to communicate were
conveyed to the mind of the prophet, or they were not; if they were so
conveyed, then the prophet must have comprehended them, and intended to
express them correctly&mdash;for it is monstrous to suppose that God
would infuse ideas into a man&rsquo;s mind for the purpose of being
communicated to the public; which ideas he yet did not enable him to
communicate; and then all the above confused subtleties fall to the
ground. If, on the other hand, these ideas were not so conveyed to the
prophet&rsquo;s mind, then it must have been the <i>words</i> and not
the <i>ideas</i> which were inspired, and God used the prophet simply
as a flute (a supposition scouted by Dr. Arnold) and we are thus driven
to the equally monstrous supposition that God used words which did not
convey his meaning, even to the very favored individual to whom and
through whom he spoke.&rdquo; (Greg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creed of
Christendom,&rdquo; pp. 76, 92<span class="corr" id="xd21e728" title=
"Source: ,">.</span>)</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already had ample proof that the Jewish writers not
only did not scruple to narrate past events as if predicting future
ones&mdash;to present history in the form of prophecy, but that they
habitually did so. The original documents from which the books of Moses
were compiled, must have been written, as we have seen in the time of
the earliest kings, while the book of Deuteronomy was not composed, and
the whole Pentateuch did not assume its present form till, probably,
the reign of Josiah; yet they abound in such anticipatory
narrative&mdash;in predictions of events long past. The instances are
far too numerous to quote.&rdquo; (Greg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creed of
Christendom,&rdquo; p. 86.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not throughout the whole Bible any word that
describes to us what we call a poet, nor any word that describes what
we call poetry. The case is, that the word <i>prophet</i>, to which
latter times have affixed new ideas, was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>the Bible word for poet,
and the word <i>prophesying</i> meant the art of making poetry. It also
meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any instrument of
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We read of prophesying with pipes, tabrets, and
horns&mdash;of prophesying with harps, with psalteries, with cymbols,
and with every other instrument of music then in fashion. Were we now
to speak of prophesying with a fiddle, or with a pipe and tabor, the
expression would have no meaning, or would appear ridiculous, and to
some people contemptuous, because we have changed the meaning of the
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are told of Saul being among the <i>prophets</i>, and also
that he prophesied, but we are not told what <i>they prophesied</i>,
nor what <i>he prophesied</i>. The case is, there was nothing to tell;
for these prophets were a company of musicians and poets, and Saul
joined in the concert, and this was called
prophesying.&rdquo;&mdash;Thomas Paine on the Prophecies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no reason to think that a prophet ever received a
revelation which was not spoken directly and pointedly to his own time.
(Ency. Brit. &ldquo;Bible.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is plain, however, that the whole work (the Pentateuch) is
not the uniform production of one pen, but that in some way a variety
of records of different ages, and styles have been combined to form a
single narrative. Accordingly, Jewish tradition bears evidence that
Moses wrote the Pentateuch, Joshua the book named after him, Samuel the
book of Judges, and so forth. <i>As all Hebrew history is
anonymous</i>, a sure sign that people had not yet learned to lay
weight on questions of authorship, it is not probable that this
tradition rests on any surer ground than conjecture.&rdquo; (Ency.
Brit., &ldquo;Bible.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have now fully and fairly analyzed and exposed many of the
most important prophecies or pretended prophecies of the whole Bible, I
have shown that very few of them are real prophecies at all; that those
which are real prophecies, very few ever have been, or ever can be
fulfilled; that the very few which seem to have been fulfilled were
written <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>after the occurrence of the events claimed to be
their fulfilments, and that, whether fulfilled or unfulfilled, none of
these prophecies ever have been, or ever can be, of any service to the
world. And thus fall all the prophetic props of priestcraft. Not one of
them can bear the test of fair examination.&rdquo; (Kelso&rsquo;s

<h2 class="main">MIRACLES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;At the very outset of inquiry into the origin
and true character of Christianity we are brought face to face with the
supernatural. Christianity professes to be a Divine Revelation of
truths which the human intellect could not otherwise have discovered.
It is not a form of religion developed by the wisdom of man and
appealing to his reason, but a system miraculously communicated to the
human race, the central doctrines of which are either supernatural or
untenable. If the truths said to be revealed were either of an ordinary
character, or naturally attainable they would at once discredit the
claim to divine origin. No one could maintain that a system
discoverable by reason would be supernaturally communicated. The whole
argument for Christianity turns upon the necessity of such a
revelation, and the consequent probability that it would be made. * *
<span class="corr" id="xd21e774" title="Not in source">*</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The spontaneous offer of miraculous evidence, indeed, has
always been advanced as a special characteristic of Christianity
logically entitling it to acceptance in contradistinction to all other
religions. &lsquo;It is an acknowledged historical fact,&rsquo; says
Bishop Butler, &lsquo;that Christianity offered itself to the world,
and demanded to be received, upon the allegation, that is, as
unbelievers would speak, upon the pretence of miracles, publicly
wrought to attest the truth of it in such an age; ... and Christianity,
including the dispensation of the Old Testament, seems distinguished by
this from all other religions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having then ascertained that miracles are absolutely
necessary to attest the reliability of a Divine Revelation we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>may proceed to examine them more closely, and for
the present we shall confine ourselves to the representation of these
phenomena which are in the Bible. Throughout the Old Testament the
doctrine is inculcated that supernatural communications must have
supernatural attestation. God is described as arming his servants with
power to perform wonders, in order that they may thus be accredited as
his special messengers. The Patriarchs and the people of Israel
generally are represented as demanding &lsquo;a sign&rsquo; of the
reality of the communications said to come from God, without which, we
are led to suppose, they not only would not have believed, but would
have been justified in disbelieving, that the messengers actually came
from him. Thus Gideon asks for a sign that the Lord talked with
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he (Gideon) said unto him, If now I have found grace in
thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.&rsquo;

href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jgs%206:16-17">Judges
6&nbsp;: 16, 17</a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hezekiah demands proof of the truth of Isaiah&rsquo;s
prophecy that he should be restored to health.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that
the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of the
Lord the third day?&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>&ldquo;It is, however, unnecessary to refer to instances, for it may
be affirmed that upon all occasions, miraculous evidence of an alleged
divine mission is stated to have been required and accorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The startling information is at the same time given, however,
that miracles may be wrought to attest what is false as well as to
accredit what is true. In one place, it is declared that if a prophet
actually gives a sign or wonder and it comes to pass, but teaches the
people on the strength of it, to follow other gods, they are not to
hearken to him, and the prophet is to be put to death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
and giveth thee a sign or wonder, and the sign or <span class=

come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other
gods which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not
hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of
dreams.&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>&ldquo;The false miracle is here attributed to God himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the book of the prophet Ezekiel the case is stated in a
still stronger way, and God is represented as directly deceiving the
prophet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I
the Lord have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand
upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people

in order to bring more plagues upon the land of <span class="corr" id=

fact, is represented as exerting his almighty power to deceive a man
and then destroying him for being deceived. In the same spirit is the
passage in which Micaiah describes the Lord as putting a lying spirit
into the mouths of the prophets who incited Ahab to go to
Ramoth-gilead. (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>&ldquo;The miracles wrought by the <span class="corr" id="xd21e833"

Moses were done by another power than God. We have notable instances of
the belief in <i>signs</i> and <i>wonders</i> wrought by this other
power. Jesus is represented as warning his disciples against false
prophets, who work signs and wonders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
prophesied in thy name? and in thy name cast out devils? and in thy
name done many wonderful works? of whom he should say, I never knew
you, depart from me, ye that work iniquity.&rsquo; (<a class=

<p>And again in another place: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;For false prophets shall arise, and shall work signs and
wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, the elect.&rsquo; (<a class=

"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2013:22">Mark 13:
22</a>.)</p>
<p>Also, when the Pharisees accuse him of casting out devils by
Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, Jesus asks: &lsquo;By whom do your
children cast them out?&rsquo; a reply which would lose all its point
if they were not admitted to be able to cast out devils. In another
passage John is described as saying: &lsquo;Master, we saw one casting
out devils in thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbade
him.&rsquo; Without multiplying instances, however, there can be no
doubt of the fact that the reality of false miracles and lying wonders
is admitted in the Bible. The obvious deduction from this
representation of miracles is that the source and purpose of such
supernatural phenomena must always be exceedingly uncertain. Their
evidential value is, therefore, profoundly affected, &lsquo;it
being,&rsquo; as Dr. Newman has said of ambiguous miracles,
&lsquo;antecedently improbable that the Almighty should rest the credit
of his Revelation upon events which but obscurely implied his immediate
presence.&rsquo; As it is affirmed that other supernatural beings
exist, as well as an assumed personal God, by whose agency miracles are
performed, it is impossible to argue with reason that such phenomena
are at any time especially due to the intervention of the Deity. Dr.
Newman recognizes this, but passes over the difficulty with masterly
lightness of touch. After advancing the singular argument that our
knowledge of spirits is only derived from scripture, and that their
existence cannot be deduced from nature, whilst he asserts that the
being of a God&mdash;a personal God be it remembered&mdash;can be so
discovered, and that, therefore, miracles can only properly be
attributed to him, he proceeds: &lsquo;Still it may be necessary to
show that on our own principles we are not open to inconsistency. That
is, it has been questioned whether, in admitting the existence and
power of the spirits on the authority of Revelation, we are not in
danger of invalidating the evidence upon which that authority rests.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>For the cogency of the argument for miracles
depends on the assumption, that interruptions in the course of nature
must ultimately proceed from God; which is not true, if they may be
effected by other beings without his sanction. And it must be conceded,
that, explicit as scripture is in considering miracles as signs of
divine agency, it still does seem to give created spirits some power of
working them; and even, in its most literal sense, intimates the
possibility of their working them in opposition to the true doctrine
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2013:1-3">Deut.
13&nbsp;: 1&ndash;3</a>; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

2&nbsp;: 9&ndash;11</a>).&rsquo; (Dr. Newman&rsquo;s Two Essays on
Miracles, p. 31.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Newman repudiates the attempts of various writers to
overcome this difficulty by making a distinction between great miracles
and small, many miracles and few, or by referring to the nature of the
doctrine attested in order to determine the author of the miracles, or
by denying the power of spirits altogether, and explaining away
scripture statements of demoniacal possession and the narrative of the
Lord&rsquo;s temptation<span class="corr" id="xd21e870" title=
"Not in source">.</span> &lsquo;Without having recourse to any of these
dangerous modes of answering the objection,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;it
may be sufficient to reply, that, since, agreeably to the antecedent
sentiment of reason, God has adopted miracles as the seal of a divine
message, we believe he will never suffer them to be so counterfeited as
to deceive the humble inquirer.&rsquo; (Ibid. p. 51.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the only reply which even so powerful a reasoner as
Dr. Newman can give to an objection based on distinct statements of
scripture itself. He cannot deny the validity of the objection, he can
only hope or believe in spite of it. Personal belief independent of
evidence is the most common and the weakest of arguments; at best it is
prejudice masked in the garb of reason. It is perfectly clear that
miracles being thus acknowledged to be common both to God and to other
spirits they cannot be considered a distinctive attestation of divine
intervention; and as Spinoza finely argued, not even the mere existence
of God, can be inferred from them; for as a miracle is a limited act
and never expressed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>more than certain and limited power, it is
certain that we cannot from such an effect, conclude even the existence
of a cause whose power is infinite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dual character obviously leads to many difficulties in
defining the evidential function and force of miracles, and we may best
appreciate the dilemma which is involved by continuing to follow the
statements and arguments of divines themselves. To the question whether
miracles are absolutely to command the obedience of those in whose
sight they are performed, and whether upon their attestation, the doer
and his doctrine are to be accepted as of God, Archbishop French
unhesitatingly replies: &lsquo;It cannot be so, for side by side with
the miracles which serve for the furthering of the kingdom of God runs
another line of wonders, the counter-workings of him who is ever the
ape of the Most High.&rsquo; (Dr. French&rsquo;s &lsquo;Notes on the
Miracles of Our Lord.&rsquo;) Eighth ed., p. 22.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This fact,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that the kingdom of
lies has its wonders no less than the kingdom of truth, is in itself
sufficient evidence that miracles cannot be appealed to absolutely and
finally, in proof of the doctrine which the worker of them
proclaims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This being the case, it is important to discover how miracles
perform their function as the indispensible evidence for a Divine
Revelation, for with this disability they do not seem to possess much
potentiality. Archbishop French<a id="xd21e884" name="xd21e884"></a>
then offers the following definition of the function of miracles:
&lsquo;A miracle does not prove the truth of a doctrine or the divine
mission of him that brings it to pass. That which alone it claims for
him at the first is a right to be listened to; it puts him in the
alternative of being from heaven or from hell. The doctrine must first
commend itself to the conscience as being <i>good</i>, and only then
can the miracle seal it as <i>divine</i>.&rsquo; But the first appeal
is from the doctrine to the conscience, to the moral nature of man.
Under certain circumstances, he maintains their evidence is utterly to
be rejected. &lsquo;But the purpose of the miracle&rsquo; he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>says, &lsquo;being as we have seen, to confirm
that which is good, so, upon the other hand, where conscience and mind
witness against the doctrine, not all the miracles in the world have a
right to demand submission to the word which they seal. On the
contrary, the great act of faith is to believe, against, and in despite
of them all, in what God has revealed to, and implanted in the soul of
the holy and the true; not to believe another gospel, though an angel
from heaven, or one transformed into such should bring it (<a class=

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:8">Gal. 1&nbsp;:
8</a>); and instead of compelling assent, miracles are then rather
warnings to us that we keep aloof, for they tell us that not merely
lies are here, for to that the conscience bore witness already, but
that he who utters them is more than a common deceiver, is eminently a
liar and anti-Christ, a false prophet; standing in more immediate
connection than other deceived and evil men to the kingdom of darkness,
so that Satan has given him his power (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2013:2">Rev. 13&nbsp;:
2</a>); is using him to be an especial organ of his, and to do a
special work for him.&rsquo; And he lays down the distinct principle
that: &lsquo;The miracle must witness for itself, and then, and then
only, the first is capable of witnessing for the second.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These opinions are not peculiar to the Archbishop of Dublin,
but are generally held by divines, although Dr. French expresses them
with unusual absence of reserve. Dr. Mozley emphatically affirms the
same doctrine when he says: &lsquo;A miracle cannot oblige us to accept
any doctrine which is contrary to our moral nature or a fundamental
principle of religion.&rsquo; Dr. Mansel speaks to the same effect:
&lsquo;If a teacher claiming to work miracles proclaims doctrines
contrary to previously established truths, whether to the conclusions
of natural religion or to the teaching of a former revelation, such a
contradiction is allowed even by the most zealous defenders of the
evidential value of miracles, to invalidate the authority of the
teacher. But the right conclusion from this admission is not that true
miracles are invalid an evidences, but that the supposed miracles in
this case are not true miracles at all; that is, are not the effects
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>of divine power, but of human deception or of some
other agency.&rsquo; A passage from a letter written by Dr. Arnold,
which is quoted by Dr. French in support of his views, both illustrates
the doctrine and the necessity which has led to its adoption.
&lsquo;You complain,&rsquo; says Dr. Arnold, writing to Dr. Hawkins,
&lsquo;of those persons who judge of a revelation not by its evidence,
but by its substance. It has always seemed to me that its substance is
a most essential part of its evidence; and that miracles wrought in
favor of what was foolish or wicked would only prove Manicheism. We are
so perfectly ignorant of the unseen world, that the character of any
supernatural power can only be judged by the moral character of the
statements which it sanctions. Thus only can we tell whether it be a
revelation from God or from the Devil.&rsquo; In another place Dr.
Arnold declares: &lsquo;Miracles must not be allowed to overrule the
gospel; for it is only through our belief in the gospel that we accord
our belief in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is obvious that the mutual dependence which is thus
established between miracles and the doctrines in connection with which
they are wrought destroys the evidential force of miracles, and that
the first and final appeal is made to reason. The doctrine in fact
proves the miracles instead of the miracle attesting the doctrine.
Divines, of course, attempt to deny this, but no other deduction from
their own statements is logically possible. Miracles according to
scripture itself, are producible by various supernatural beings and may
be satanic as well as divine: man on the other hand, is so ignorant of
the unseen world that avowedly, he cannot, from the miracle itself,
determine the agent by whom it was performed; the miracle, therefore,
has no intrinsic evidential value. How, then, according to divines,
does it attain any potentiality? Only through a favorable decision on
the part of reason on the &lsquo;moral nature of man&rsquo; regarding
the character of the doctrine. The result of the appeal to reason
respecting the morality and credibility of the doctrine determines the
evidential status of the miracle. The doctrine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>therefore, is the real criterion of the miracle
which, without it, is necessarily an object of doubt and suspicion.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e913" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>We have already casually referred to Dr.
Newman&rsquo;s view of such a relation between miracle and doctrine,
but may here more fully quote his suggestive remarks. &lsquo;Others by
referring to the nature of the doctrine attested,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;in order to determine the author of the miracle, have exposed
themselves to the plausible charge of adducing, first the miracle to
attest the divinity of the doctrine, and then the doctrine to prove the
divinity of the miracle.&rsquo; This argument he characterizes as one
of the &lsquo;dangerous modes&rsquo; of removing a difficulty, although
he does not himself point out a safer, and in a note, he adds:
&lsquo;There is an appearance of doing honor to the Christian doctrines
in representing them as <i>intrinsically</i> credible, which leads many
into supporting opinions which, carried to their full extent, supercede
the need of miracles altogether. It must be recollected, too, that they
who are allowed to praise have the privilege of finding fault, and may
reject, according to their <i>a priori</i> notions, as well as receive.
Doubtless the divinity of a clearly immoral doctrine could not be
evidenced by miracles; for our belief in the moral attributes of God,
is much stronger than our conviction of the negative proposition, that
none but he can interfere with the system of nature. But there is
always the danger of extending this admission beyond its proper limits,
of supposing ourselves judges of the <i>tendency</i> of doctrines; and
because, unassisted reason informs us what is moral and immoral in our
own case, of attempting to decide on the abstract morality of
actions.... These remarks are in nowise inconsistent with using (as was
done in a former section) our actual knowledge of God&rsquo;s
attributes, obtained from a survey of nature and human affairs, in
determining the probability of certain professed miracles having
proceeded from him. It is one thing to infer from the experience of
life another to imagine the character of God from the gratuitous
conceptions of our own minds.&rsquo; Although Dr. Newman apparently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>fails to perceive that he himself thus makes
reason the criterion of miracles and therefore incurs the condemnation
with which our quotation opens, the very <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e927" title="Source: indicision">indecision</span> of his argument
illustrates the dilemma in which divines are placed. Dr. Mozley,
however, still more directly condemns the principle we are discussing,
that the doctrine must be the criterion of the miracle, although he
also, as we have seen elsewhere, substantially affirms it. He says:
&lsquo;The position that the revelation proves the miracle, and not the
miracles the revelation, admits of a good qualified meaning; but taken
literally, it is a double offense against the rule, that things are
properly proved by the proper proof of them; for a supernatural fact
<i>is</i> the proper proof of supernatural doctrine, while a
supernatural doctrine on the other hand is certainly <i>not</i> a
proper proof of a supernatural fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This statement is obviously true, but it is equally
undeniable that, their origin being uncertain, miracles have no
evidential force. How far then, we may inquire in order thoroughly to
understand the position, can doctrines prove the reality of miracles or
determine the agency by which they are performed? In the case of moral
truths within the limits of reason, it is evident that doctrines, which
are in accordance with our idea of what is good and right do not
require miraculous evidence at all. They can secure acceptance by their
own merits alone. At the same time it is universally admitted that the
truth or goodness of a doctrine could not attest the divine origin of a
miracle. Such truths, however, have no proper connection with
revelation at all. &lsquo;<i>These</i> truths,&rsquo; to quote the
words of Bishop Atterbury, &lsquo;were of themselves sufficiently
obvious and plain, and needed not a divine testimony to make them
plainer. But the truths which are necessary in this manner to be
attested, are those which are of positive institution; those which if
God had not pleased to reveal them, human reason could not have
discovered; and those, which, even now, they are revealed, human reason
cannot fully account for, and perfectly comprehend.&rsquo; How is it
possible then that reason, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>or the &lsquo;moral nature of
man&rsquo; can approve as good, or appreciate the fitness of, doctrines
which in their very nature are beyond the criterion of reason. What
reply, for instance, can reason give to any appeal to it regarding the
doctrine of the trinity or of the incarnation? If doctrines, the truth
and goodness of which are apparent, do not afford any evidence of
divine revelation, how can doctrines which reason can neither discover
nor comprehend attest the divine origin of miracles? Dr. Mozley clearly
recognizes that they cannot do so. &lsquo;The proof of a
revelation,&rsquo; he says, and we may add, the proof of a
miracle&mdash;itself a species of revelation&mdash;&lsquo;which is
contained in the substance of a revelation has this inherent check or
limit in it; namely: that it cannot reach to what is undiscoverable by
reason.&rsquo; &lsquo;Internal evidence is itself an appeal to reason,
because at every step the test is our own appreciation of such and such
an idea or doctrine, our own perception of its fitness; but human
reason cannot in the nature of the case prove that which, by the very
hypotheses, lies beyond reason.&rsquo; It naturally follows that no
doctrine which lies beyond reason, and therefore requires the
attestation of miracles, can possibly afford that indication of the
source and reality of miracles which is necessary to endow them with
evidential value, and the supernatural doctrine must, therefore, be
rejected in the absence of miraculous evidence of a decisive
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canon Mozley labors earnestly, but unsuccessfully, to restore
to miracles as evidence some part of that potentiality of which these
unfortunate limitations have deprived them. &lsquo;Whilst on the one
hand<span class="corr" id="xd21e946" title=
"Not in source">,</span>&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;we must admit indeed an
inherent modification in the function of a miracle as an instrument of
proof,&rsquo; he argues that this is only a limitation, and no disproof
of it, and he contends that: &lsquo;The evidence of miracles is not
negatived because it has conditions.&rsquo; His reasoning, however, is
purely apologetic, and attempts by the unreal analogy of supposed
limitations of natural principles and evidence to excuse the
disqualifying limitations of the supernatural. He is quite conscious of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>the serious difficulty of the position: &lsquo;The
question&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;may at first sight create a
dilemma.&mdash;If a miracle is nugatory on the side of one doctrine,
what cogency has it on the side of another? Is it legitimate to accept
its evidence when we please and reject it when we please?&rsquo; The
only reply he seems able to give to these very pertinent questions is
the remark which immediately follows them: &lsquo;But in truth a
miracle is never without an argumentative force, although that force
may be counterbalanced.&rsquo; In other words, a miracle is always an
argument, although it is often a bad one. It is scarcely necessary to
go to the supernatural for bad arguments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might naturally be expected that the miraculous evidence
selected to accredit a divine revelation should possess certain unique
and marked characteristics. It must at least, be clearly distinctive of
divine power and exclusively associated with divine truth. It is
inconceivable that the Deity, deigning thus to attest the reality of a
communication from himself of truths beyond the criterion of reason,
should not make the evidence simple and complete, because the doctrines
proper to such a revelation, not being appreciable from internal
evidence, it is obvious that the external testimony for them,&mdash;if
it is to be of any use&mdash;must be unmistakable and decisive. The
evidence which is actually produced, however, so far from satisfying
these legitimate anticipations, lacks every one of the qualifications
which reason antecedently declares necessary. Miracles are not
distinctive of divine power but are common to Satan, and they are
admitted to be performed in support of falsehood as well as in the
service of truth. They bear, indeed, so little upon them the impress of
their origin and true character, that they are dependent for their
recognition upon our judgment of the very doctrines to attest which
they are said to have been designed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even taking the representation of miracles, therefore, which
divines themselves give, they are utterly incompetent to perform their
contemplated functions. If they are superhuman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>they are
not supersatanic, and there is no sense in which they can be considered
miraculously evidential of anything. To argue as theologians do, that
the ambiguity of their testimony is intended as a trial of our faith is
absurd, for reason being unable to judge of the nature either of
supernatural fact or of supernatural doctrine it would be mere folly
and injustice to subject to such a test beings avowedly incapable of
sustaining it. Whilst it is absolutely necessary, then, that a divine
revelation should be attested by miraculous evidence to justify our
believing it the testimony so called seems in all respects unworthy of
the name, and presents anomalies much more suggestive of human
invention than divine <span class="corr" id="xd21e957" title=
"Source: orignality">originality</span>. We are, in fact, prepared by
the scriptural account of miracles to expect that further examination
will supply an explanation of such phenomena which will wholly remove
them from the region of the supernatural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen that a divine revelation is such only by virtue
of communicating to us something which we could not know without it,
and which is in fact undiscoverable by human reason; and that
miraculous evidence is absolutely requisite to establish its reality.
It is admitted that no other testimony could justify our believing the
specific revelation which we are considering, the very substance of
which is supernatural and beyond the criterion of reason, and that its
astounding announcements, if not demonstrated to be miraculous truths,
must inevitably be pronounced &lsquo;the wildest delusions.&rsquo; On
examining the supposed miraculous evidence, however, we find that not
only is it upon general grounds antecedently incredible, but that the
testimony by which its realty is supported, so far from establishing
the inferences drawn from the supposed supernatural phenomena, is
totally insufficient even to certify the actual occurrence of the
events narrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if the reality of miracles could be substantiated, their
value as evidence for the divine revelation is destroyed by the
necessary admission that miracles are not limited to one source, but
that there are miracles satanic which are to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>be
disbelieved, as well as divine and evidential ones to be believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Similar miracles to those which are supposed to attest it are
reported long antecedent to the promulgation of Christianity, and
continued to be performed for centuries after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stream of miraculous pretension, in fact, has flowed
through all human history, deep and broad as it has passed through the
darker ages, but dwindling down to a thread as it has entered days of
enlightenment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The true character of miracles is at once betrayed by the
fact that their supposed occurrence has been confined to ages of
ignorance and superstition, and that they are absolutely unknown in any
time or place where science has provided witnesses fitted to appreciate
and ascertain the nature of such exhibitions of supernatural power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no uncertainty as to the origin of belief in
supernatural interference with nature. The assertion that spurious
miracles have sprung up round a few instances of genuine miraculous
power has not a single valid argument to support it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we turn from more general arguments to examine the
documentary evidence for the reality of the supposed miraculous
occurrences, and of the divine revelation which they accredit, we meet
with the characteristics which might have been expected. We do not find
any trace even of the existence of our gospels for a century and a half
after the events they record. They are anonymous narratives, and there
is no evidence of any value connecting these works with the writers to
whom they are popularly attributed. The miraculous evidence upon which
alone, it is admitted, we could be justified in believing its
astounding doctrines being thus nugatory, the claims of Christianity to
be considered a divine revelation must necessarily be disallowed, and
its supernatural elements, which are, in fact, the very substance of
the system, inevitably sharing the same fate as the supposed miraculous
evidence, must, therefore, be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>rejected as incredible and opposed to
reason and complete induction.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Supernatural
Religion,&rdquo; p. 698.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle as evidence can establish no fact, for the reason
that the miracle does not exist. The miracle itself must be attested.
As we have no evidence of miracles, we are not called on to believe
them, but to believe the story which relates them. &lsquo;But the
miracle is above and beyond reason.&rsquo; To this we reply: It is
absurd to assume what is beyond reason, to account for what is opposed
to reason.&rdquo; (Ibid.)</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">David Hume&rsquo;s Argument on Miracles.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature;
and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws,
the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as
entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined. Why is
it more than probable that all men must die; that lead cannot of itself
remain suspended in the air; that fire consumes wood, and is
extinguished by water; unless it be that these events are found
agreeable to the laws of nature, and there is required a violation of
these laws, or, in other words, a miracle, to prevent them? Nothing is
esteemed a miracle if it ever happen in the common course of nature. It
is no miracle that a man seemingly in good health should die suddenly;
because such a kind of death, though more unusual than any other, has
yet been frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle that a dead
man should come to life; because that has never been observed in any
age or country. There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against
every miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that
appellation. And as a uniform experience amounts to a proof there is
here a direct and full <i>proof</i>, from the nature of the fact,
against the existence of any miracle; nor can such a proof be destroyed
or the miracle rendered credible but by an opposite proof which is
superior. (2.)</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e990" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The plain consequence is (and it is a
general maxim worthy of our attention), &lsquo;that no testimony is
sufficient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of
such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact
which it endeavors to establish; and even in that case there is a
mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an
assurance suitable to that degree of force which remains after
deducting the inferior.&rsquo; When any one tells me that he saw a dead
man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself whether it be
more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or
that the fact which he relates should really have happened. I weigh the
one miracle against the other, and according to the superiority which I
discover I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater
miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous
than the event which he relates, then, and not till then, can he
pretend to command my belief or opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed that the
testimony upon which a miracle is founded may possibly amount to an
entire proof, and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real
prodigy; but it is easy to show that we have been a great deal too
liberal in our concession, and that there never was a miraculous event
established on so full an evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, <i>first</i>, there is not to be found, in all history,
any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men of such unquestioned
good sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all
delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity as to place them
beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit
and reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose
in case of their being detected in any falsehood; and, at the same
time, attesting facts performed in such a public manner, and in so
celebrated a part of the world, as to render the detection unavoidable;
all which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in
the testimony of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Secondly.</i> We may observe in human nature a principle
which, if strictly examined, will be found to diminish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>extremely the assurance which we might, from human
testimony, have in any kind of prodigy. The maxim by which we commonly
conduct ourselves in our reasonings is, that the objects of which we
have no experience resemble those of which we have; that what we have
found to be most usual is always most profitable, and that where there
is an opposition of argument we ought to give the preference to such as
are founded on the greatest number of past observations; but though, in
proceeding by this rule, we readily reject any fact which is unusual
and incredible in an ordinary degree, yet in advancing further the mind
observes not always the same rule, but when anything is affirmed
utterly absurd and miraculous it rather the more readily admits of such
a fact, upon account of that very circumstance which ought to destroy
all its authority. The passion of <i>surprise</i> and <i>wonder</i>
arising from miracles, being an agreeable emotion, gives a sensible
tendency toward the belief of those events from which it is derived.
And this goes so far, that even those who can not enjoy this pleasure
immediately, nor can believe those miraculous events of which they are
informed, yet love to partake of the satisfaction at second-hand or by
rebound, and take pride and delight in exciting the admiration of
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what greediness are the miraculous accounts of travelers
received, their descriptions of sea and land monsters, their relations
of wonderful adventures, strange men and uncouth manners! But if the
spirit of religion joins itself to the love of wonder, there is an end
of common sense, and human testimony, in these circumstances, loses all
pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast, and
imagine he sees what has no reality; he may know his narrative to be
false, and yet persevere in it with the best intentions in the world,
for the sake of promoting so holy a cause; or even where this delusion
has not place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation, operates on
him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other
circumstances, and self-interest with equal force. His <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>auditors
may not have, and commonly have not, sufficient judgment to canvass his
evidence; what judgment they have, they renounce by principle, in these
sublime and mysterious subjects; or if they were ever so willing to
employ it, passion and a heated imagination disturb the regularity of
its operations. Their credulity increases his impudence, and his
impudence overpowers their credulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eloquence, when at its highest pitch, leaves little room for
reason or reflection, but, addressing itself entirely to the fancy or
the affections, captivates the willing hearers and subdues their
understanding. Happily, this pitch it seldom attains. But what a Tully
or a Demosthenes could scarcely effect over a Roman or Athenian
audience, every Capuchin, every itinerant or stationary teacher, can
perform over the generality of mankind, and in a higher degree, by
touching such gross and vulgar passions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The many instances of forged miracles and prophecies, and
supernatural events, which in all ages have either been detected by
contrary evidence or which detect themselves by their absurdity, prove
sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and
the marvelous, and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all
relations of this kind. This is our natural way of thinking, even with
regard to the most common and most credible events. For instance, there
is no kind of report which rises so easily and spreads so quickly,
especially in country places and provincial towns, as those concerning
marriages: insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see
each other twice but the whole neighborhood immediately join them
together. The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting, of
propagating it, and of being the first reporters of it, spreads the
intelligence. And this is so well known that no man of sense gives
attention to these reports till he finds them confirmed by some greater
evidence. Do not the same passions, and others still stronger, incline
the generality of mankind to believe and report, with the greatest
vehemence and assurance, all religious miracles? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thirdly.</i> It forms a strong presumption against all
supernatural and miraculous relations that they are observed chiefly to
abound among ignorant and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people
has ever given admission to any of them, that people will be found to
have received them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors, who
transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority which
always attend received opinions. When we peruse the first histories of
all nations, we are apt to imagine ourselves transported into some new
world, where the whole frame of nature is disjointed, and every element
performs its operations in a different manner from what it does at
present. Battles, revolutions, pestilence, famine, and death, are never
the effect of those natural causes which we experience. Prodigies,
omens, oracles, judgments, quite obscure the few natural events that
are intermingled with them. But as the former grow thinner every page,
in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages, we soon learn
that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the case, but that
all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind toward the marvelous;
and that though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from
sense and learning, it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It is strange</i>, a judicious reader is apt to say upon
the perusal of those wonderful historians, that such <i>prodigious</i>
events never happen in <i>our</i> days. But it is nothing strange, I
hope, that men should lie in all ages. You must surely have seen
instances enough of that frailty. You have yourself heard many such
marvelous relations started, which, being treated with scorn by all the
wise and judicious, have at least been abandoned even by the vulgar. Be
assured that those renowned lies, which have spread and flourished to
such a monstrous height, arose from like beginnings; but being sown in
a more proper soil, shot up at last into prodigies almost equal to
those which they relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a wise policy in that false prophet Alexander, who,
though now forgotten, was once so famous, to lay the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>first
scene of his impostures in Paphlagonia, where, as Lucian tells us, the
people were extremely ignorant and stupid, and ready to swallow even
the grossest delusion. People at a distance who are weak enough to
think the matter at all worth inquiry have no opportunity of receiving
better information. The stories come magnified to them by a hundred
circumstances. Fools are industrious in propagating the imposture;
while the wise and learned are contented, in general, to deride its
absurdity, without informing themselves of the particular facts by
which it may be distinctly refuted. And thus the imposture above
mentioned was enabled to proceed, from his ignorant Paphlagonians, to
the enlisting of votaries even among the Grecian philosophers and men
of the most eminent rank and distinction in Rome; nay, could engage the
attention of that sage emperor Marcus Aurelius, so far as to make him
trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive
prophecies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advantages are so great of starting an imposture among an
ignorant people that, even though the delusion should be too gross to
impose on the generality of them, which, though <i>seldom</i>, is
<i>sometimes</i> the case, it has a much better chance for succeeding
in remote countries than if the first scene had been laid in a city
renowned for arts and knowledge. The most ignorant and barbarous of
these barbarians carry the report abroad. None of their countrymen have
a large correspondence of sufficient credit and authority to contradict
and beat down the delusion. Men&rsquo;s inclination to the marvelous
has full opportunity to display itself. And thus a story, which is
universally exploded in the place where it was first started, will pass
for certain at a thousand miles distant. But had Alexander fixed his
residence at Athens, the philosophers of that renowned mart of learning
would have spread, throughout the whole Roman empire, their sense of
the matter; which, being supported by so great an authority, and
displayed by all the force of reason and eloquence, would have entirely
opened the eyes of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56"
name="pb56">56</a>]</span>mankind. It is true Lucian, passing by chance
through Paphlagonia, had an opportunity of performing this good office.
But though much to be wished, it does not always happen that every
Alexander meets with a Lucian ready to expose and detect his
impostures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may add as a <i>fourth</i> reason which diminishes the
authority of prodigies, that there is no testimony for any, even those
which have not been expressly detected, that is, not opposed by any
infinite number of witnesses; so that not only the miracle destroys the
credit of testimony, but the testimony destroys itself. To make this
the better understood, let us consider that in matters of religion,
whatever is different is contrary; and it is impossible that the
religions of ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, and of China, should all
of them be established on any solid foundation. Every miracle,
therefore, pretended to have been wrought in any of those religions
(and all of them abound in miracles), as its direct scope is to
establish the particular system to which it is attributed, so has it
the same force, though more indirectly, to overthrow every other
system. In destroying a rival system, it likewise destroys the credit
of those miracles on which that system was established; so that all the
prodigies of different religions are to be regarded as contrary facts;
and the evidences of these prodigies, whether weak or strong, as
opposite to each other. According to this method of reasoning, when we
believe any miracle of Mahomet or his successors, we have for our
warrant the testimony of a few barbarous Arabians: and on the other
hand, we are to regard the authority of Titus, Livius, Plutarch,
Tacitus, and, in short, of all the authors and witnesses&mdash;Grecian,
Chinese, and Roman Catholic, who have related any miracle in their
particular religion; I say we are to regard their testimony in the same
light as if they had mentioned that Mahometan miracle, and had in
express terms contradicted it, with the same certainty as they have for
the miracle they relate. This argument may appear over subtile and
refined; but is not in reality different from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>the
reasoning of a judge who supposes that the credit of two witnesses,
maintaining a crime against any one is destroyed by the testimony of
two others who affirm him to have been two hundred leagues distant at
the same instant when the crime is said to have been committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the best-attested miracles in all profane history is
that which Tacitus reports of Vespasian, who cured a blind man in
Alexandria by means of his spittle, and a lame man by the mere touch of
his foot, in obedience to a vision of the god <i>Serapis</i>, who had
enjoined them to have recourse to the emperor for these miraculous
cures. The story may be seen in the works of that historian (Hist. lib.
v. cap. 8. Suetonius gives nearly the same account in Vitia Vesp.),
where every circumstance seems to add weight to the testimony, and
might be displayed at large with all the force of argument and
eloquence, if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of
that exploded and idolatrous superstition: The gravity, solidity, age,
and probity of so great an emperor, who, through the whole course of
his life conversed in a familiar manner with his friends and courtiers,
and never affected those extraordinary airs of divinity assumed by
Alexander and Demetrius. The historian, a contemporary writer, noted
for candor and veracity, and, withal, the greatest and most penetrating
genius perhaps of all antiquity, and so free from any tendency to
credulity that he even lies under the contrary imputation of Atheism
and profaneness. The persons from whose authority he related the
miracle, of established character for judgment and veracity, as we may
well presume; eye witnesses of the fact, and confirming their testimony
after the <i>Flavian</i> family was despoiled of the empire, and could
no longer give any reward as the price of a lie. <i>Utrumque, qui
interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, postquam nullum, mendacio
pretium.</i> To which if we add the public nature of the facts as
related, it will appear that no evidence can well be supposed stronger
for so gross and palpable a falsehood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is also a memorable story related by Cardinal de Retz,
which may well deserve our consideration. When that intriguing
politician fled into Spain to avoid the persecution of his enemies, he
passed through Saragossa, the capital of Arragon, where he was shown,
in the cathedral, a man who had served seven years as a doorkeeper, and
was well known to everybody in town that had ever paid his devotions at
that church. He had been seen, for so long a time, wanting a leg; but
recovered that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the stump; and the
cardinal assures us that he saw him with two legs. This miracle was
vouched by all the canons of the church; and the whole company in town
were appealed to for a confirmation of the fact; whom the cardinal
found by their zealous devotion, to be thorough believers of the
miracle. Here the relater was also contemporary to the supposed
prodigy, of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of great
genius, the miracle of so <i>singular</i> a nature as could scarcely
admit of a counterfeit, and the witnesses very numerous, and all of
them, in a manner spectators, of the fact to which they gave their
testimony. And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence, and may
double our surprise on this occasion, is that the cardinal himself, who
relates the story, seems not to give any credit to it, and consequently
can not be suspected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He
considered, justly, that it was not <span class="corr" id="xd21e1079"
title="Source: requsite">requisite</span>, in order to reject a fact of
this nature, to be able accurately to disprove the testimony, and to
trace its falsehood through all the circumstances of knavery and
credulity which produced it. He knew that as this was commonly
altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place, so was
it extremely difficult, even where one was immediately present, by
reason of the bigotry, ignorance, cunning, and roguery of a great part
of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a just reasoner, that such an
evidence carried falsehood upon the very face of it, and that a miracle
supported by any human testimony was more properly a subject of
derision than of argument. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=

<p>&ldquo;There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed
to one person than those which were lately said to have been wrought in
France upon the tomb of Abbe <i>Paris</i>, the famous Jansenist, with
whose sanctity the people were so long deluded. The curing of the sick,
giving hearing to the deaf, and sight to the blind, were everywhere
talked of as the usual effects of that holy sepulcher. But, what is
more extraordinary, many of the miracles were immediately proved upon
the spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by
witnesses of credit and distinction, in a learned age, and on the most
eminent theater that is now in the world. Nor is this all: a relation
of them was published and dispersed everywhere; nor were the Jesuits,
though a learned body, supported by the civil magistrate, and
determined enemies to those opinions in whose favor the miracles were
said to have been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute or detect
them. (3.) Where shall we find such a number of circumstances agreeing
to the corroboration of one fact? And what have we to oppose to such a
cloud of witnesses but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature
of the events which they relate? And this, surely, in the eyes of all
reasonable people, will alone be regarded as a sufficient
refutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the consequence just, because some human testimony has the
utmost force and authority in some cases&mdash;when it relates the
battle of Phillipi or Pharsalia, for instance&mdash;that therefore all
kinds of testimony must, in all cases, have equal force and authority?
Suppose that the C&aelig;sarean and Pompeian factions had, each of
them, claimed the victory in these battles, and that the historians of
each party had uniformly ascribed the advantage to their own sides; how
could mankind, at this distance, have been able to determine between
them? The contrariety is equally strong between the miracles related by
Herodotus or Plutarch, and those delivered by Mariana, Bede, or any
monkish historian. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The wise lend a very academic faith to every report which
favors the passion of the reporter, whether it magnifies his country,
his family, or himself, or in any other way strikes in with his natural
inclinations and propensities. But what greater temptation than to
appear a missionary, a prophet, an embassador from heaven. Who would
not encounter many dangers and difficulties in order to obtain so
sublime a character. Or if, by the help of vanity and a heated
imagination, a man has first made a convert of himself and entered
seriously into the delusion, who ever scruples to make use of pious
frauds in support of so holy and meritorious a cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest flame:
because the materials are always prepared for it. The <i>avidum genus
auricularum</i> (<span class="corr" id="xd21e1098" title=
"Source: Lucrtius">Lucretius</span>)&mdash;the gazing populace receive
greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition and
promotes wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many stories of this nature have, in all ages, been
detected and exploded in their infancy. How many more have been
celebrated for a time and have afterward sunk into neglect and
oblivion. Where such reports, therefore, fly about, the solution of the
phenomenon is obvious; and we judge in conformity to regular experience
and observation when we account for it by the known and natural
principles of credulity and delusion. And shall we, rather than have
recourse to so natural a solution, allow of a miraculous violation of
the most established laws of nature?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not mention the difficulty of detecting a falsehood in
any private or even public history at the place where it is said to
happen; much more when the scene is removed to ever so small a
distance. Even a court of judicature, with all the authority, accuracy,
and judgment which they can employ, find themselves often at a loss to
distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent actions. But
the matter never comes to any issue if trusted to the common method of
altercation and debate and flying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>rumors, especially when
men&rsquo;s passions have taken part on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly
esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or
regard. And when afterward they would willingly detect the cheat, in
order to undeceive the deluded multitude, the season is now past, and
the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished
beyond recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No means of detection remain but those which must be drawn
from the very testimony itself of the reporters; and these, though
always sufficient with the judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine
to fall under the comprehension of the vulgar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the whole, then, it appears that no testimony for any
kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability, much less to a
proof; and that even supposing it amounted to a proof, it would be
opposed by another proof, derived from the very nature of the fact
which it would endeavor to establish. It is experience only which gives
authority to human testimony; and it is the same experience which
assures us of the laws of nature. When, therefore, these two kinds of
experience are contrary, we have nothing to do but subtract the one
from the other, and embrace an opinion, either on one side or the
other, with that assurance which arises from the remainder. But
according to the principle here explained, this subtraction, with
regard to all popular religions, amounts to an entire annihilation; and
therefore we may establish it as a maxim, that no human testimony can
have such force as to prove a miracle, and make it a just foundation
for any such system of religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg the limitations here made may be remarked when I say
that a miracle can never be proved, so as to be the foundation of a
system of religion. For I own that, otherwise, there may possibly be
miracles or violations of the usual course of nature, of such a kind as
to admit of proof from human testimony; though perhaps it will be
impossible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>to find any such in all the records of history.
Thus, suppose all authors, in all languages, agree that from the first
of January, 1600, there was a total darkness over the whole earth for
eight days; suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is
still strong and lively among the people; that all travelers who return
from foreign countries bring us accounts of the same tradition, without
the least variation or contradiction&mdash;it is evident that our
present philosophers, instead of doubting the fact, ought to receive it
as certain, and ought to search for the causes whence it might be
derived. The decay, corruption, and dissolution of nature is an event
rendered probable by so many analogies, that any phenomenon which seems
to have a tendency toward that catastrophe comes within the reach of
human testimony, if that testimony be very extensive and uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose that all the historians who England treat of
should agree that on the first day of January, 1600, Queen Elizabeth
died; that both before and after her death she was seen by her
physicians and the whole court, as is usual with persons of her rank;
that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament;
and that after being interred a month she again appeared, resumed the
throne, and governed England for three years&mdash;I must confess that
I should be surprised at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances,
but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an
event. I should not doubt of her pretended death, and of those other
public circumstances that followed it; I should only assert it to have
been pretended, and that it neither was nor possibly could be real. You
would in vain object to me the difficulty, and almost impossibility, of
deceiving the world in an affair of such consequence. The wisdom and
solid judgment of that renowned queen, with the little or no advantage
she could reap from so poor an artifice&mdash;all this might astonish
me; but I would still reply that the knavery and folly of men are such
common phenomena, that I should rather believe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>the most
extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence than admit of so
signal a violation of the laws of nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of
religion, men in all ages have been so much imposed on by ridiculous
stories of that kind that this very circumstance would be a full proof
of a cheat, and sufficient with all men of sense not only to make them
reject the fact, but even reject it without further examination. Though
the being to whom the miracle is ascribed be in this case Almighty, it
does not upon that account become a whit more probable, since it is
impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a being
otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions in
the usual course of nature. This still reduces us to past observation,
and obliges us to compare the instances of the violation of truth in
the testimony of men with those of the violation of the laws of nature
by miracles, in order to judge which of them is most likely and
probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony
concerning religious miracles than in that concerning any other matter
of fact, this must diminish very much the authority of the former
testimony, and make us form a general resolution never to lend any
attention to it, with whatever specious pretense it may be covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Bacon seems to have embraced the same principles of
reasoning. &lsquo;We ought,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;to make a collection
or particular history of all monsters and prodigious births or
productions, and, in a word, of everything new, rare, and extraordinary
in nature. But this must be done with the most severe scrutiny, lest we
depart from truth. Above all, every relation must be considered as
suspicious which depends in any degree upon religion, as the prodigies
of Livy: and, no less so, every thing that is to be found in the
writers of natural magic or alchemy, or such authors who seem, all of
them, to have an unconquerable appetite for falsehood and fable.&rsquo;
(Nov. Org. lib. 2, aph. 9.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here
delivered, as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends
or disguised enemies to the Christian religion who have undertaken to
defend it by the principles of human reason. Our most holy religion is
founded on <i>faith</i>, not on reason; and it is a sure method of
exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is by no means fitted to
endure. To make this more evident, let us examine those miracles
related in scripture; and, not to lose ourselves in too wide a field,
let us confine ourselves to such as we find in the Pentateuch, which we
shall examine according to the principles of these pretended
Christians, not as the word or testimony of God himself, but as the
production of a mere human writer and historian. Here, then, we are
first to consider a book, presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant
people, written in an age when they were still more barbarous, and in
all probability long after the facts which it relates, corroborated by
no concurring testimony, and resembling those fabulous accounts which
every nation gives of its origin. Upon reading this book, we find it
full of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a state of the
world and of human nature entirely different from the present: of our
fall from that state; of the age of man extended to near a thousand
years; of the destruction of the world by a deluge; of the arbitrary
choice of one people as the favorites of heaven, and that people the
countrymen of the author; of their deliverance from bondage by
prodigies the most astonishing imaginable: I desire anyone to lay his
hand upon his heart, and, after a serious consideration, declare
whether he thinks that the falsehood of such a book, supported by such
a testimony, would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the
miracles it relates; which is, however, necessary to make it be
received according to the measures of probability above
established.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have said of miracles may be applied, without any
variation, to prophecies; and, indeed, all prophecies are real
miracles, and as such only can be admitted as proofs of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>any
revelation. If it did not exceed the capacity of human nature to
foretell future events, it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an
argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven; so that upon
the whole we may conclude that the Christian religion not only was at
first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed
by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason is insufficient to
convince us of its veracity; and whoever is moved by <i>faith</i> to
assent to it is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person
which subverts all the principles of his understanding, and gives him a
determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For hundreds of years, miracles were about the only things
that happened. They were wrought by thousands of Christians, and
testified to by millions. The saints and martyrs, the best and
greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders. Even heretics,
with the assistance of the Devil, could suspend the &lsquo;laws of
nature.&rsquo; Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they
were written by &lsquo;good men,&rsquo; by Christians, &lsquo;who made
their statements in the presence and expectation of death?&rsquo; The
truth is that these &lsquo;good men&rsquo; were mistaken. They expected
the miraculous. They breathed the air of the marvelous. They fed their
minds on prodigies, and their imaginations feasted on effects without
causes. They were incapable of investigating. Doubts were regarded as
&lsquo;rude disturbers of the congregation.&rsquo; Credulity and
sanctity walked hand in hand. Reason was danger. Belief was safety. As
the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost on the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s Reply to
Black.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believers in miracles should not try to explain them. There
is but one way to explain anything, and that is to account for it by
natural agencies. The moment you explain a miracle it disappears. You
should depend not upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66"
name="pb66">66</a>]</span>explanation, but assertion. You should not be
driven from the field because the miracle is shown to be unreasonable.
You should reply that all miracles are unreasonable. Neither should you
be in the least disheartened if it is shown to be impossible. The
possible is not miraculous. You should take the ground that if miracles
were reasonable, and possible, there would be no reward for believing
them. The Christian has the goodness to believe, while the sinner asks
for evidence. It is enough for God to work miracles without being
called upon to substantiate them for the benefit of unbelievers.&rdquo;
(Ingersoll&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mistakes of Moses,&rdquo; p. 146.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when we are told that wine was made out of water, and
bread and fish out of nothing in large quantities, we know that we are
listening to statements that simply go out of the field of credible
testimony into the realm of supreme credulity. Such assertions require
you to believe not only what you have not seen, but what all reason and
experience tell you, you never can see. They ask you not only to
believe in a past event, but in a past event outside of all reason,
unsupported by nature, opposed to all natural laws, beneath the realm
of reason, out of the light of experience, under the shadow of
superstition. The great electric light of the intellect is turned off
at the church door.&rdquo; (Helen H. Gardener. &ldquo;Men, Women, and
Gods.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This is the first time they were killed, so far as we know of. The
immediate cause of their taking off is ascribed to
&ldquo;Murrain.&rdquo; In the twenty-fifth verse of the same chapter it
is fully implied that they were killed again: &ldquo;And the hail smote
throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man
and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every
tree of the field.&rdquo; Now it is fair to infer that a hail which
&ldquo;brake every tree of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>field&rdquo; was destructive
enough to kill animals. This makes the second time they were
killed.</p>
<p>In the twelfth chapter of Exodus and twenty-ninth verse we read that
some of the same cattle were killed again, making three times that they
died: &ldquo;And it came to pass that at midnight the Lord smote all
the first born of the land of Egypt, from the first born of Pharaoh
that sat upon the throne unto the first born of the captive in the
dungeon; and the first born of cattle.&rdquo; After these repeated
deaths of the cattle, we find Pharaoh and his horsemen in full pursuit
of the fleeing Hebrews, and Pharaoh and his horsemen and horses, were
drowned in the sea. Of course it is difficult for one who is carnally
minded, to understand how cattle can be killed so many times. Possibly
the &ldquo;Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Dumb Animals&rdquo;
might have done good service had it been in full working order in those

<p>All these and many more passages which might be cited go to show
that these writers supposed heaven to be but a short distance away.
There was a constant and familiar intercourse between the gods above
and men below.</p>
<p>The Christian idea of heaven is but another form of the Greek notion
of Mt. Olympus&mdash;it is not only borrowed, but vague and mythical in
the extreme&mdash;it is childish and has much of the flavor of Santa
Claus stories.</p>

17</a>) says, &lsquo;So all the generations from Abraham to David are
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon are
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto
Christ are fourteen generations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%203:23-38">3&nbsp;:
23&ndash;38</a>) relates Christ&rsquo;s genealogy, and gives
forty-three generations between David and Christ, these two persons
being included. Here then in the genealogy of the same person is an
utterly irreconcilable discrepancy of fifteen generations. This is
truly a bad beginning. Although these two accounts may both be false
they cannot possibly both be true. If &lsquo;all the
generations,&rsquo; from David to Jesus, were only
&lsquo;twenty-eight,&rsquo; as given by Matthew, there could not
possibly have been at the same time, &lsquo;forty-three&rsquo; of them
as given by Luke. The case becomes much worse, however, when we
discover that, with the exception of Jesus, Joseph, and David, these
two authors give entirely different sets <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1348" title="Source: of of">of</span> men. Since it is utterly
impossible for the same individual to have descended through both of
these lines of ancestors, it is equally impossible for both of these
accounts to be true.&rdquo; (J. R. Kelso&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible
Analyzed.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the first glance these genealogies, as given by Matthew
and Luke, are so evidently different that it has been the ordinary, if
not invariable practice of Christian harmonists and commentators to
represent the former Evangelist as recording the descent of Joseph,
while the latter Evangelist <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>is said to have given the pedigree of
Mary. We will say nothing of the plausibility of this explanation,
which acknowledges the genealogies to be wholly different, and supposes
they belong to two persons. Our questions must rather effect the
truthfulness of this mode of explaining away the difficulty. Let the
reader bear in mind how Matthew states that &lsquo;Jacob begat Joseph
the husband of Mary,&rsquo; and how Luke&rsquo;s words are
&lsquo;Joseph which was the son of Heli,&rsquo; and then let the reader
say whether it is truthful to allege that these different genealogies
belong to different individuals. Is it not plain that each of them
professes to trace the lineal descent of one and the same man, Joseph?
If we are still to be told that when Matthew professes to give the
descent of Joseph, he is to be understood as giving the descent of
Mary, then we simply rejoin that such an explanation is nothing more
nor less than an abandonment of the idea of inspirational
infallibility; for it represents the Bible as saying one thing and
meaning another.&rdquo; (McNaught, &ldquo;Doctrine of
Inspiration.&rdquo;)</p>

<h3 class="main">When was Jesus Born?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As to the time when Jesus was born, we have no
positive information. Matthew says he was born in Herod&rsquo;s time,
and that Herod caused all the little children to be killed on account
of him. Luke says Jesus was born in the time of Cyrenius, when Augustus
C&aelig;sar gave orders that all the people should be taxed. Now,
Cyrenius succeeded Archelaus, who reigned ten years after the death of
Herod. Here is a contradiction that cannot be explained away. The exact
day of Herod&rsquo;s death can be almost arrived at, as shown by
Josephus, who says that on the night preceding the death of Herod there
was an eclipse of the moon. In calculating back to the time of this
eclipse, it is found to have occurred on the fourth of March, four
years before Christ; another perplexing discrepancy. Matthew says he
was born in the days of Herod, and John says it was in the days of
Cyrenius, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>fourteen years afterward. Again, Mark and Luke say
Jesus began to be thirty years of age in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius, the very day of whose accession is known; and by
counting back, we find that Jesus must have been born four years before
the Christian era, which disagrees entirely with the statement of
Matthew.</p>
<p>Professor John Fiske remarks that while the Jesus of the dogma is
the best known, the Jesus of history is the least known of all the
eminent names in history. &ldquo;Persons who had given much attention
to the subject affirmed that there were not less than one hundred and
thirty-two different opinions as to the year in which the Messiah
appeared.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Conflict Between Religion and Science,&rdquo;
p. 184.)</p>
<p>Dr. Adam Clarke, on observations of <a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:8">Luke 2&nbsp;:
8</a>, in his Commentary says: &ldquo;The nativity of Jesus in December
should be given up. The Egyptians placed it in January; Wagenseil in
February; Bochart in March. Some mentioned by Clemens Alexandrine in
April; others in May. Epiphanius speaks of some who placed it in June,
and others supposed it to have been in July. Wagenseil, who was not
sure of February, fixed it as probably in August; Lightfoot on the
fifteenth of September. But the Latin church [Catholic], supreme in
power and infallible in judgment, placed it on the twenty-fifth of
December, the very day on which the ancient Romans celebrated the feast
of their goddess, Bruma. Pope Julius I. (in the fourth century) made
the first alteration, and it appears to have been done for this
reason.&rdquo; The Christians often aim to make an argument that the
chronology of the Christian era is established by the confirmation that
is given by the years being numbered from the supposed birth of Jesus,
but it is no proof at all. The idea of counting the years from the
advent of Jesus was not thought of for several centuries after the time
when the vague legends said he was supposed to have lived. The plan of
numbering the years from that apocryphal event was first invented by a
monk, Dionysius Exiguus, about 530 after Christ. It was introduced into
Italy not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>long afterward, and was propagated by Bede, who
died in 735. It was ordered to be used by the bishops in the Council of
Chalcedon in 816, but it was not generally employed for several
centuries afterward. It was not legalized until the year 1000. Charles
III. of Germany was the first sovereign who added &ldquo;In the year of
our Lord&rdquo; to his reign, in 879. (See Haydn&rsquo;s Dictionary of
Dates, and Encyclopedia of Chronology.)</p>
<p>Now, in recapitulation, let us see how much, by the common sense
method of interpreting the gospels, we have been forced to reject as
incredible.</p>
<p>First, we have seen that Joseph&rsquo;s dream concerning the
immaculate conception was, after all, only a dream, and that wonderful
dreams are not uncommon; Samson&rsquo;s mother having had one which is
so identical with Joseph&rsquo;s, that we are persuaded that the dream
of the latter is but a copy of the dream of the former; that almost all
men of distinction in ancient times were reported to have had wonderful
prodigies attending their conception and birth,&mdash;and that there is
no evidence in the gospels of the resurrection of Jesus. Paul saw him
in a vision, that is, in his mind&rsquo;s eye, but does not claim to
have seen him in the flesh. And of the ascension, it is a self-evident
fiction.</p>
<p>The miracles are not only incredible from their being incompatible
with and contrary to human experience, but the manner in which they are
related proves that they never were performed. (See
&ldquo;Miracles.&rdquo;) And concerning the moral teachings of Jesus we
find great imperfection. He did not come to save all men, but only the
lost sheep of the house of Israel; he taught that the end of the world
was nigh at hand, when a great physical revolution should usher in the
kingdom of heaven, but it did not come. We find also that Jesus did not
respect the rights of property; that he despised this world; that he
condemned the rich because they were rich, and made great promises to
the poor because they were poor; that he professed to pardon sin, and
on one occasion pardoned a person&rsquo;s sins for washing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>his
feet; that he exhibited an imperfect sense of justice in a great many
instances; and, lastly, we find that there is no history of him
excepting the gospels, and in these there is no unquestionable record
of the time when or the place where he was born. We are forced to
conclude that if ever there was such a person as Jesus of Nazareth, we
have no trustworthy sources of positive knowledge concerning him.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise:
When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came
together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph
her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public
example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on
these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
saying, Joseph thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;

the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1. How could any one but Mary say who the father of the child
was?</p>
<p>2. If the conception was miraculous then neither Mary nor any one
else could know ought of the paternity of the child.</p>
<p>3. Mary says nothing about the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>4. Who found out that Joseph had had such a dream?</p>
<p>5. Was it duly reported and verified then and there?</p>
<p>6. The book that relates the dream is anonymous and does not appear
in history until A. D. 180&ndash;182.</p>
<p>7. The writers of the other three gospels know nothing of this
dream.</p>

personally knew Mary. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"

<h3 class="main">THE GOLDEN RULE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The moral teachings of the Bible are not original.
Back of the pyramids in pre-historic times mothers taught their
children to be kind to each other. Not from heaven but out of the human
heart came the golden rule. A mother&rsquo;s love was sufficient to
reveal this best rule of life. Human inspiration is the only
inspiration needed to call forth the expression&mdash;&ldquo;Do unto
others as ye would have them do unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sixty years before the Christian era, Hellel, a Jewish rabbi wrote:
&ldquo;Do not do to others, what you would not like others to do to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hundred and eighty years before Christ, Epicurus said: &ldquo;It
is more blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three hundred and fifty years before Christ, Socrates said:
&ldquo;Act toward others as you desire them to act toward
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three hundred and seventy years before Christ, Aristippus said:
&ldquo;Cherish reciprocal benevolence, which will make you as anxious
for another&rsquo;s welfare as your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three hundred and eighty-five years before Christ, Aristotle wrote:
&ldquo;We should conduct ourselves toward others, as we would have them
act toward us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hundred years before Christ, Sextus said: &ldquo;What you wish
your neighbors to be to you, such be also to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hundred and twenty years before Christ, Plato wrote: &ldquo;May
I do to others as I would have them do to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five hundred years before Christ, Confucius taught: &ldquo;Do unto
another what you would have him do to you, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>and do
not to another what you would not have him do unto you: it is the
foundation principle of all the rest.&rdquo; (24th Maxim Confucius.)
Jesus concludes by saying, &ldquo;For this is the law and the
prophets,&rdquo; and Confucius closes his rule by observing,
&ldquo;Thou only needst this law alone; it is the foundation and
principle of all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it should not be overlooked that Jesus, in thus attributing the
golden rule to &ldquo;the law and the prophets,&rdquo; disclaims its
authorship. Confucius does the same.</p>
<p>Six hundred years before Christ, Thales said: &ldquo;Avoid doing
what you would blame others for doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six hundred and fifty years before Christ, Pittacus taught:
&ldquo;Do not do to your neighbor what you would take ill from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the system of morals propounded in the New Testament
contains no maxim which had not been previously enunciated, and that
some of the most beautiful passages in the apostolic writings are
quotations from Pagan authors, are well known to every scholar; and so
far from supplying, as some suppose, an objection against Christianity,
it is a strong recommendation of it, as indicating the intimate
relation between the doctrines of Christ and the moral sympathies of
mankind in different ages. But to assert that Christianity communicated
to man moral truths previously unknown, argues on the part of the
assertor, either gross ignorance or else wilful fraud.&rdquo; (Buckle,
&ldquo;History of Civilization,&rdquo; vol. 1, p. 129.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did space admit, I could cite numerous passages from Enoch in
close correspondence with the New Testament scripture, in many cases
almost word for word. In that book, as in the Talmud, and as was held
by the Jews in general (saving the Sadducees), may be found the exact
doctrines taught by Jesus relative to the Son of Man coming in the
clouds of heaven, the resurrection of the dead, the day of judgment,
the punishment of the wicked in everlasting fire, and the reward of the
righteous in heaven. The eschatology of Jesus is borrowed in toto from
that prevalent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>in Judea during his lifetime. Not one single new
idea respecting the &lsquo;four final things,&rsquo; death, judgment,
heaven, and hell, can be found in Jesus&rsquo; teachings as embodied in
the gospels.&rdquo;&mdash;Wm. Emmette Coleman.</p>

I will read a few extracts from an essay entitled, &lsquo;The Essenes
Their History and Doctrines.&rsquo; Dr. Ginsburg says: &lsquo;The
identity of many of the precepts and practices of Essenism and

8</a>); so the Essenes, who, as a body, in waiting for the kingdom of
heaven, abstained from connubial intercourse. The Essenes did not offer
animal sacrifices, but strove to present their bodies a living
sacrifice, holy and acceptable, unto God, which they regarded as a
reasonable service; the apostle Paul exhorts the Romans to do the same.

life of purity and holiness as to be the temples of the holy spirit and
to be able to prophesy; the apostle Paul urges the Corinthians to covet
to prophesy. (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

When Christ pronounced John to be Elias (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2011:14">Mat. 11&nbsp;:
14</a>), he declared that the Baptist had already attained to that
spirit and power which the Essenes strove to obtain in their highest
stage of purity. It will therefore hardly be doubted that our Savior
himself belonged to this holy brotherhood. This will especially be
apparent when we remember that the whole Jewish community, at the
advent of Christ, was divided into three parties, the Pharisees, the
Sadducees, and the Essenes, and that every Jew had to belong to one of
these sects. Jesus, who in all things conformed to Jewish law, who was
holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners, would naturally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>associate himself with that order of Judaism which
was most congenial to his holy nature. Moreover, the fact that Christ,
with the exception of once, was not heard of in public till his
thirtieth year, implying that he lived in seclusion with this
fraternity, and that though he frequently rebuked the Scribes,
Pharisees, and Sadducees, he never denounced the Essenes, strongly
confirms this conclusion.... The accounts given by Josephus first
mentioned their existence in the days of Jonathan the Maccabaean, B. C.
166; and they most unquestionably show that the Essenes existed at
least two centuries before the Christian era, and that they at first
lived among the Jewish community at large. Their residence at Jerusalem
is also evident from the fact that there was a gate named after them.
When they ultimately withdrew themselves from the rest of the Jewish
nation, the majority of them settled on the northwest shore of the Dead
Sea, sufficiently distant to escape its noxious exhalations, and the
rest lived in scattered communities throughout Palestine and Syria.
Both Philo and Josephus estimated them to be above four thousand in
number. This must have been exclusive of women and children. We hear
very little of them after this period (that is, 40 A. D.); and there
can hardly be any doubt that, owing to the great similarity which
existed between their precepts and practices, and those of the
primitive Christians, the Essenes, as a body, must have embraced
Christianity.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Underwood, in Underwood-Marples

<h3 class="main">Jesus&rsquo; Teachings Not up to the Moral Standard of
To-day.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Jesus failed to explicitly teach any of the
cardinal human virtues. If he taught kindness and forgiveness it was
usually at the expense of justice.</p>
<p>2. He nowhere explains and inspires self-reliance and individual
liberty.</p>
<p>3. He nowhere condemns kingcraft, priestcraft and tyranny. He
opposes their abuses, but not the radical evils out of which they
spring. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>4. He has no just ideas of marriage and divorce.</p>
<p>5. He nowhere explains the nature of heaven and hell.</p>
<p>6. He does not teach the value of economy and thrift, but turns
people loose with the notion that they must take no thought for the
morrow.</p>
<p>The following saying of Jesus exhibits the lack of a high moral
sense of justice, and also the fact that he does not pretend to be the
savior of the whole human race. He said to his own countrymen:
&ldquo;Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God,
but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables;
that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear,
and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and
their sins be forgiven them. (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:11">Mark 4&nbsp;:
11</a>.)</p>
<p>From this we learn that Jesus did not desire to save the Gentiles;
the parabolical style was used in order to prevent them from becoming
converted and having their sins pardoned.</p>
<p>In addition to this imperfection of the moral sense, Jesus was
sometimes unforgiving in his spirit and practice. He says on one
occasion: &ldquo;Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also
deny before my father which is in heaven.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2010:33">Mat. 10&nbsp;:
33</a>.)</p>
<p>It is true that he taught his disciples to love their enemies, but
it is a precept he did not observe himself; he allowed himself to speak
of those who did not accept his teachings as, &ldquo;fools,&rdquo;
&ldquo;hypocrites,&rdquo; &ldquo;thieves,&rdquo;
&ldquo;serpents,&rdquo; &ldquo;vipers,&rdquo; and many other abusive
epithets, which clearly exhibit on his part anger and hatred. We have
another instance of his unforgiving spirit in that myth of the dying
thief on the cross. It is there recorded that Jesus prayed for the
forgiveness of his enemies, but had he been consistent with that
prayer, he would not have pardoned one thief without also pardoning the
other. When he could ask God to forgive his enemies, it would have been
demanded by his own rule, that he also forgive them; but, on the
contrary, he only forgives the malefactor who spoke <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>words in
his praise. This spirit is carried out in the doctrine of future
rewards and punishments.</p>

<h3 class="main">Jesus Exhibits an Imperfect Sense of Justice.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In failing to recognize the rights of property; in his
denunciation of the rich; in his teachings of submission to wrong; in
his professing to pardon sin, even before it is asked for, Jesus errs.
This moral sense is lacking in his teachings concerning God. Take this
as an illustration: &ldquo;Which of you shall have a friend, and shall
go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three
loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
nothing to set before him. And he from within shall answer and say,
Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in
bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not
rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his
importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2011:15">Luke
11&nbsp;: 15</a>.)</p>
<p>And so it is with God, he leads us to believe, for though he is our
friend he will not grant our requests; but if we annoy and tease him,
at last, worn out, he will answer our prayers to get rid of us.
Therefore, &ldquo;Ask and it shall be given you; for every one that
asketh receiveth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parable of the unfortunate widow is another instance in point:
&ldquo;There was in a city a judge who feared not God, neither regarded
man [same kind of judges in our cities now]. And there was a widow in
that city, and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
And he would not for a while; but afterwards he said within himself,
Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth
me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary
me.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2018:2-6">Luke
18&nbsp;: 2&ndash;6</a>.) It is just so in praying to God. He may not
hear you or heed you at first, yet by a &ldquo;continual coming and
troubling him,&rdquo; he must of necessity at last become weary and
grant you the desires of your heart, in order to escape being troubled.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>At one time the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman to Jesus who
had been taken in the act of adultery, and asked for his judgment. He
said: &ldquo;He that is without sin among you let him first cast a
stone at her.&rdquo; This was a well-directed rebuke, and they felt it,
and they &ldquo;went out one by one, beginning at the eldest even unto
the last.&rdquo; Then Jesus, standing alone with the woman, asks,
&ldquo;Woman where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned
thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I
condemn thee; go and sin no more.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%208:7-11">John 8&nbsp;:
7&ndash;11</a>.)</p>
<p>In all parts of the Bible adultery is condemned, and by all civil
laws it is now prohibited, and all religious teaching forbids it, and
there is no reason in this case why Jesus should not have condemned the
act, even while he showed mercy to the actor. Here as elsewhere Jesus
shows mercy at the expense of justice. Were these principles carried
out in life, the criminal would go untried and unpunished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the village over against you, and straightway you
shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them and bring them
unto me. And if any man say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
need of them, and <span class="corr" id="xd21e1603" title=
"Source: staightway">straightway</span> he will send them. All this was
done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
saying, Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king cometh unto
thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt, the foal of an ass.
And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the
ass, and the colt, and put on their clothes, and set him
thereon.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2021:2-7">Mat.
21&nbsp;: 2&ndash;7</a>.)</p>
<p>The writer would have us believe that Jesus rode upon two asses at
once; but the prophet who could invent such a story must have been an
ass himself to suppose that Jesus could ride upon two donkeys of such
unequal size at one time. It was not the prophet, however, who
perpetrated this outrage upon common sense, but the writer of Matthew,
whoever he was. Mark, Luke, and John mentioned the affair, and all
agree in speaking of one ass only. Had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>the writer read the
prophet aright, he would have quoted it differently, &ldquo;Behold thy
King cometh unto thee, ... lowly, and sitting upon an ass; even a colt,
the foal of an ass.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zec%209:9">Zech. 9&nbsp;:
9</a>.)</p>
<p>Another instance of this disregard of the interests of others is
exhibited by Jesus where he casts the devils out of two men and permits
them to enter the swine, &ldquo;and the swine ran down a steep place
into the sea and perished in the waters.&rdquo; Mark (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%205:12">5&nbsp;:
12</a>) says there were about two thousand head, but there is not a
word said about the equity of the proceeding. In this case Jesus does
not offer any compensation for the destruction of property which had
been caused by him.</p>
<p>He does not make even an apology or an explanation. No wonder, then,
that the people became alarmed at this and asked him to go on his
journey with as little delay as possible: &ldquo;The whole city came
out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he
would depart out of their coasts.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%208:34">Mat. 8&nbsp;:
34</a>.)</p>
<p>Another instance of this lack of the sense of justice is displayed
in the parable of Dives and Lazarus. The one goes to heaven, that is,
to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, because he was poor, and the other to hell,
because he was rich. Say what we may our civilization is built upon
wealth. Civilization, the highest and noblest estate of man, is
achieved by the utter repudiation of poverty. The legitimate love of
money is the spur of all human progress. Civilization would speedily
degenerate into barbarism if this respect for property was removed.</p>
<p>His views of poverty are in harmony with his teachings on other
human interests: &ldquo;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth;&rdquo; &ldquo;Take no thought for the morrow; for the morrow
shall take thought for the things of itself.&rdquo; How evident it is
that one of the most essential virtues of life is here repudiated.</p>
<p>Thoughtfulness about the future is a distinguishing trait of a wise
man. To take no thought for the morrow <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>would be as foolish as
for one to bind himself hand and foot on the approach of his enemy.
Science inspires man with earnest inquiry about the morrow, and also
enables him by his perception of it how better to live to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
of thee, turn not thou away.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%205:42">Mat. 5&nbsp;:
42</a>.) Society as it now exists would not last a single day if his
command were obeyed. Borrowing and lending is poor business, even as it
is now carried on, but what it would become under the universal
practice it would be impossible to guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
have ye? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
again.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206:34">Luke 6&nbsp;:
34</a>.) So impracticable a precept is this, that no people have ever
practiced it, nor could it be carried out without the demoralization
and overthrow of civilization.</p>

<h3 class="main">Jesus Teaches the Duty of Submission to Wrong.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general doctrines of resignation and contentment
are incompatible with strength of character and progress in life. The
most worthy members of society everywhere are just those people who
have the least resignation and contentment. Jesus does not seem to have
cherished these conditions himself. He was neither contented nor
resigned to the social status about him. &ldquo;The powers that
be&rdquo; did not seem to him to be from above, but from beneath, and
he accordingly waged war upon the existing social evils. But Jesus also
teaches the duty of submission to wrong: &ldquo;And unto him that
smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and him that
taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every
man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask
them not again.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206:29-30">Luke
6&nbsp;: 29, 30</a>.) Just think of it! &ldquo;And of him that taketh
away thy goods, ask them not again.&rdquo; Society would be overthrown
in a day if this command was carried out. We should have no commerce,
no law protecting our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>various interests, no civilized society. Paul
echoes the same notion when he says, &ldquo;Now, therefore, there is
utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why
do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to
be defrauded?&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:7">1 Cor.
6&nbsp;: 7</a>.)</p>
<p>Suffer yourselves to be defrauded! If human life has any virtue at
all, it surely consists in some degree in doing the very opposite, that
is, in not suffering ourselves to be defrauded. It is true that love
seems at first sight to be an all-important virtue, and one incapable
of abuse; but such love as induces us to submit to wrong is spurious.
In the world as it exists about us, we are culpable when we suffer
ourselves to be defrauded. The common virtues which are recognized by
all men are courage and resistance to wrong. Everywhere our eyes turn,
we look to see the hero who nobly resists the wrongs and frauds which
the powerful perpetrate upon the weak and helpless. &ldquo;Resistance
to tyrants is the will of God&rdquo; is the modern conception of duty.
And in accordance therewith we have laws prohibiting wrong and fraud.
Besides there is no manliness, self-reliance, or self-respect
compatible with such craven submission, which is spiritless and
purposeless. John Stuart Mill observes of Christianity: &ldquo;Its
ideal is negative rather than positive; passive rather than active;
innocence rather than nobleness; abstinence from evil rather than
energetic pursuit of good. In its precepts (as has been well said),
&lsquo;thou shalt not&rsquo; predominates over &lsquo;thou
shalt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

have been God, all-wise; being hungry, he went to a fig tree, when the
season of figs was not yet come. Of course there were no figs on the

interesting account to a true orthodox trinitarian. Such a one will
believe: first, that Jesus was God, who made the tree and prevented it
from bearing figs; second, that, God the all-wise, who is not subject
to human passions being hungry went to the fig tree, on which he knew
there were no figs, expecting to find some there; third, that God the

<h3 class="main">The Resurrection of Jesus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Comparing now the several narratives of the
resurrection with one another, we find this general result:</p>
<p>In Mark Jesus is said to have appeared three times.</p>
<p>1. To Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>2. To two disciples.</p>
<p>3. To the disciples at meat.</p>
<p>Two such appearances only are recorded in Matthew: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. To the women.</p>
<p>2. To the eleven in Galilee.</p>
<p>In Luke he appears:</p>
<p>1. To Cleopas and his companion.</p>
<p>2. To Peter.</p>
<p>3. To the eleven and others.</p>
<p>In the last chapters of John the appearances amount to four:</p>
<p>1. To Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>2. To the disciples without Thomas.</p>
<p>3. To the disciples with Thomas.</p>
<p>4. To several disciples on the Tiberias lake.</p>
<p>Paul extends them to six:</p>
<p>1. To Peter.</p>
<p>2. To the twelve.</p>
<p>3. To more than five hundred.</p>
<p>4. To James.</p>
<p>5. To all the apostles.</p>
<p>6. To Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon this most momentous question every one of the Christian
writers is at variance with every other.&rdquo; (Amberley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Analysis of Religious Belief,&rdquo; p. 273.)</p>
<p>They differ as to the number of women who visited the sepulcher.
John mentions only <i>one</i>; Matthew names <i>two</i>, Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary. Mark says there were <i>three</i>, the two Marys
and Salome. Luke says there were <i>more</i> than three, the two Marys,
Joanna, and certain others with them. They differ as to the number of
persons in white seen at the sepulcher. Mark mentions <i>one</i>,
&ldquo;a young man.&rdquo; Matthew speaks of <i>one</i>, an angel. Luke
says there were <i>two</i> men, and John that there were <i>two</i>
angels. They disagree us to what was said by the persons in white.
According to Matthew and Mark, they spoke of the resurrection of Jesus
and his departure into Galilee, and sent a message to his disciples
commanding them to follow him thither. In Luke they simply said that he
was risen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>and referred to a former prediction of his to this
effect. In John they simply asked Mary, &ldquo;Woman! why weepest
thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Discrepancies as to where Jesus went after his resurrection.
Matthew, dismissing Jesus from history with these words, &ldquo;Go ye
therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:19">28&nbsp;:
19</a>), seems to know nothing of the ascension; for it in utterly
incompatible with the assumption that he is an honest and faithful
historian. He could not possibly neglect recording so important an
event had he known it, and the plain inference&mdash;the irresistible
conclusion is that if he did not record it, it was because no such
thing had occurred.</p>
<p>See with what brevity Mark concludes the career of Jesus. Mark gives
these as the parting words of Jesus: &ldquo;So then after the Lord had
spoken unto them he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right
hand of God.&rdquo; (16&nbsp;: 19.)</p>
<p>How brief is the description of this wonderful scene! No writer that
had witnessed such a sight could possibly condense his thoughts and
feelings concerning it into one sentence. He would have had much to
say; namely, of his own thoughts and emotions on the occasion, and what
other witnesses said and did at the time the event occurred. Writers
who go into particulars on less marvelous affairs would not be likely
to dash off the most wonderful event that had ever happened before
human eyes in one sentence. The thing is utterly improbable and
incredible. &ldquo;He was received up into heaven&rdquo; reveals the
credulity and superstition of the times. How could the writer know
where he had gone, if he had once passed away from his sight? Moreover,
he knew nothing of a local heaven or of a personal God, yet he says
that Jesus &ldquo;sat (down) on the right hand of God,&rdquo; as though
the Infinite Power which pervades the universe had two hands and was
made in the image of man!</p>
<p>The only rational explanation we can put upon such language is to
suppose it written by one who was not present <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>at the
time referred to, but had heard of it and had undertaken to give his
version of what he heard, perhaps in the attempt trying to reconcile
two or three different versions of the story, and at the same time
weave in his own opinion on the subject. At any rate, whoever wrote it,
the writer does not claim to have been an eye-witness, and the
legendary character of the account proves that the myth had been handed
down to him.</p>
<p>Luke (24&nbsp;: 50, 51) says: &ldquo;And he led them out as far as
to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them; and it came to
pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into
heaven.&rdquo; This version leaves out the sitting on the right hand of
God&mdash;yet it has the same superstition of a local heaven&mdash;of
which the writer speaks as if he had as positive and distinct knowledge
as he claims to have of Jesus and his resurrection.</p>
<p>If Matthew closes without giving us anything of the after life and
death of Jesus&mdash;if he breaks off abruptly without giving us any
insight into the feelings of the disciples, Luke does not. He says that
after they had witnessed the departure of Jesus they worshiped him and
returned to Jerusalem with <i>great joy</i>. (24&nbsp;: 52.) But this
is totally unnatural. We cannot imagine disciples rejoicing in the loss
of their friend. It is not human nature to be glad on such occasions.
We always grieve in parting with friends. The father grieves when he
parts with his son, the mother weeps when she gives the parting kiss to
her daughter. It may be said in reply that the disciples had faith that
Jesus had gone to heaven. But this will not meet the difficulty, for
Christian mothers believe when they part with their sweet, innocent
babes that they go straight to heaven, but does this belief dry their
tears or soothe their anguished hearts? No, those mothers are
frequently tormented to frenzy and even madness by the intense grief
occasioned by loss of their dear ones. It is human nature to grieve
upon the loss of friends, but here we find disciples who do not mourn
when their dearest friend has departed from them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>They
were glad of it, and so they &ldquo;returned to Jerusalem with <i>great
joy</i>.&rdquo; Such a paragraph as this could have been inserted in
the story by some subsequent writer, but never could have been written
by one who had witnessed such an event. Another feature of this
description, as given by Luke, is that it seems to be a slightly varied
copy of the account given of Elijah. &ldquo;And it came to pass, as
they still went on, and talked, that behold there appeared a chariot of
fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went
up by a whirlwind into heaven.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%202:11">2 Kings
2&nbsp;: 11</a>.)</p>
<p>How closely Luke&rsquo;s account seems to resemble this! &ldquo;And
he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and
blessed them. And it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted
from them and carried up into heaven.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:50-51">Luke
24&nbsp;: 50, 51</a>.) &ldquo;And when he had spoken these things,
while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of
their sight.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:9">Acts 1&nbsp;:
9</a>.)</p>
<p>How suggestive is the fact that the writers do not undertake to tell
how he was translated! The writer of the book of Kings gives us a
&ldquo;chariot of fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;a whirlwind&rdquo; as the
<i>modus operandi</i> of translating Elijah from one world to the other
(?), but here there are no agencies mentioned, and so far as the
writers are concerned, there seems to be nothing incomplete or
unreasonable in the statements that he &ldquo;was carried up into
heaven,&rdquo; and &ldquo;was taken up and a cloud received him out of
their sight.&rdquo; We must suppose that persons witnessing such an
extraordinary event would have some notions as to the <i>means</i> used
in translating Jesus above the clouds, and that they could not fail to
express them in giving an account of what they had seen. Their silence
on this point, and the utter incredibility of the story make it
apparent that the writer is merely recording myths.</p>
<p>The last chapters of John are silent concerning the ascension. Now,
as it is generally admitted by the best biblical critics that the last
twelve verses of the last chapter of Mark are spurious, we have then
only one of the four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"
name="pb96">96</a>]</span>biographers of Jesus who mentions the
ascension. It is utterly improbable that these three other writers
should deliberately refuse to give an account of the greatest event
they had ever seen. We must consider the discrepancies of the writers
concerning the number of days that Jesus remained on earth after his
resurrection.</p>
<p>According to Luke&rsquo;s account, he did not remain on earth <i>one
day</i>. &ldquo;To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2023:43">Luke
23&nbsp;: 43</a>)&mdash;that is, in heaven; see <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%2012:4">2 Cor.
12&nbsp;: 4</a>. In this same twenty-third chapter of Luke, Jesus does
not ascend until the <i>third day</i> after his crucifixion; and in
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:3">Acts
1&nbsp;: 3</a>, it is recorded that he was &ldquo;seen of them <i>forty
days</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another slight discrepancy occurs in relation to the length of time
Jesus was in the grave. Matthew says (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2012:40">12&nbsp;:
40</a>), &ldquo;For as Jonas was three nights in the whale&rsquo;s
belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth.&rdquo; But as Jesus was only two nights and one day
in the grave there is no analogy between the two, hence the statement
is radically erroneous.</p>
<p>An orthodox clergyman critic explains this seeming contradiction in
this way: &ldquo;In regard to Jesus being only one day and two nights
in the grave, the very same quantity of time &lsquo;three days and
three nights,&rsquo; and which according to our computation was one
whole day, parts of two others and two whole nights, is termed three
days and three nights in the book of Esther. There is no impropriety in
this interpretation.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; as
here used is slightly equivocal, as is also the phrase &ldquo;according
to our computation.&rdquo; It is peculiar to mathematics that it does
not change <i>according to our computation</i> or any kind of
<i>interpretation</i>. It is always true that two and two make four
whether the book of Esther acknowledges the fact or not. And it not
only damages the gospels to bring forth this sort of evidence, but it
seriously derogates from the inspiration of the book of Esther, which
thus attempts in defiance of arithmetic to make one day and two nights
into three days and three nights. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>No one saw Jesus come from the grave. When Mary Magdalene came to
the sepulcher, &ldquo;Behold there was a great earthquake, for the
angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
stone from the door and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning
and his raiment white as snow. And for fear of him the keepers did
shake and become as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the
women, Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
<i>He is not here</i>, for he is risen as he said. Come see the place
where the Lord lay.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:2-6">Mat.
28&nbsp;: 2&ndash;6</a>.)</p>
<p>We have here the stone at the door of the sepulcher, and yet the
body of Jesus had risen and departed from the tomb. There would seem to
be no need in closing the grave after he had risen. But a more serious
criticism must be made upon the fact that it is not pretended that
there was any eye-witness of Jesus coming from the sepulcher. We have
only the word of an angel, but as a story abounding with conversations
of angels is legendary we are not permitted to take their testimony.
Besides, we have serious contradictions concerning the number of angels
seen. Matthew says there was one angel, and that he rolled back the
stone from the door and sat upon it. Mark says that when Mary Magdalene
and Mary the mother of James and Salome, had brought sweet spices, that
they might come and anoint him; and very early in the morning, etc.
&ldquo;And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulcher? And when they looked, they saw that the
stone <i>was rolled away</i>, for it was very great. And entering, they
saw a <i>young man</i> sitting on the right side, clothed in a long
white garment, and they were affrighted.&rdquo; (16&nbsp;:
1&ndash;3.)</p>
<p>Luke also says the stone was rolled away when the women came to the
sepulcher, and upon entering in, behold &ldquo;<i>two</i> men&rdquo;
<i>stood</i> by them in shining garments. John says Mary saw <i>two</i>
angels in white <i>sitting</i>, the one at the head <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>and the
other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. Besides, she sees
the stone rolled away from the door. Matthew records the descent of an
angel from heaven; the other biographers of Jesus know nothing of this
starting point of the angel. Matthew here says that the angel rolled
away the stone from the door, but Mark, Luke, and John say that the
stone <i>was rolled</i> from the door of the sepulcher when Mary
Magdalene came to it. Matthew here relates that Mary Magdalene saw an
angel sitting upon the stone at the door outside of the sepulcher, but
Mark says she saw a young man sitting down <i>inside</i> the sepulcher.
Luke avers that she saw two men <i>standing</i> inside of it, and John
affirms that Mary Magdalene sees two men <i>sitting</i>, &ldquo;one at
the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had
lain;&rdquo; but they do not tell her that Jesus had risen, as did the
angel in Matthew, and the young man in Mark, and the two men in
Luke.</p>
<p>According to John, Jesus first appeared to Mary Magdalene. But
according to Luke Jesus did not first appear to Mary Magdalene, but to
two persons traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus: the name of one of them
we are told was Cleopas. (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:13">Luke 24&nbsp;:
13</a>.) But this appearance of Jesus to brethren who were not apostles
is clearly legendary. The other synoptics seem to know nothing of it.
It is wholly improbable that Jesus should, after his resurrection,
appear first of all to two unknown Christians after this manner and
accompany them upon such a journey.</p>
<p>Now all the attendant circumstances of this event are mysterious,
inexplicable, and improbable; and the closing paragraph removes the
account beyond sober history. &ldquo;And it came to pass as he sat at
meat with them, he took bread and blessed it and broke and gave to
them. And their eyes were opened and they knew him, and he vanished out
of their sight.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:30-31">Luke
24&nbsp;: 30, 31</a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their eyes were holden,&rdquo; is superstitious, and as for
his vanishing out of sight, we have the most unmistakable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>traces
of legend&mdash;the fruit of ignorance and childish imagination.</p>
<p>We are called upon to believe that with feet, the bones of which
were broken and crushed with the spikes driven through them on the
cross, he traveled back to Jerusalem about as rapidly as did the two
persons with whom he journeyed to Emmaus. How could he walk upon feet
thus crippled? His hands were yet unhealed, although his
fellow-travelers did not perceive such wounds, nor did they notice that
he stepped haltingly.</p>
<p>He possessed the same <i>material</i> body which he had before his
death. He could be <i>seen</i> and <i>touched</i>. All of which shows
that he not only possessed a physical organization, but that it was the
same body he had before his death. And yet this body could vanish from
the two unknown brethren at Emmaus, it could travel rapidly, it could
come in through closed doors, it could ascend from earth out of sight
contrary to the laws of gravitation; he had flesh and bones, and could
eat and drink. &ldquo;And when he had thus spoken he showed them his
hands and his feet, and while they believed not for joy and wondered,
he said unto them, Have ye any meat? And they took and gave him a piece
of broiled fish and honeycomb, and he took it and <i>did eat</i> before
them.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:41-43">Luke
24&nbsp;: 41&ndash;43</a>.)</p>
<p>It is useless to attempt any explanation of this difficulty by
calling his body a spiritual body. The disciples on this occasion, when
Jesus suddenly appeared among them, thought they had seen a
<i>spirit</i>, but Jesus wishing to disabuse their minds, said,
&ldquo;Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and
see; for a spirit <i>hath not flesh and bones</i>, as ye see me
have.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:39">Luke 24&nbsp;:
39</a>.)</p>
<p>If we accept this plain declaration, then, we are forced to enquire
what became of this physical body. It surely must have died. It is
certain that if he ate and drank, he had a nutritive system&mdash;a
human organism&mdash;subject to death. And what became of this
&ldquo;corruptible body?&rdquo; Matthew and John do not pretend to know
anything about the matter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=
"#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>Mark has no knowledge of the final
disposition of his body, for the last twelve verses of Mark are
generally regarded as spurious. Why should not all these writers have
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2117" title=
"Source: possesed">possessed</span> the same information that Luke
pretends to have? They do not write to complement and supplement the
writings of one another, but each claims to give the important features
of Jesus&rsquo; biography independently. Is not the end of Jesus&rsquo;
career on earth important, in order to understand his life and
character? Three of the four biographers by their silence say either
that there is no importance to be attached to the ascension of Jesus,
or that it was unknown to them; in other words, that it did not
occur.</p>
<p>Passing this, we encounter irreconcilable contradictions between
different writers as to the locality <i>where</i> Jesus appeared to his
disciples after his resurrection. Matthew says the angel at the
sepulcher informed the woman to &ldquo;go quickly and tell his disciple
that he is risen from the dead, and behold he goeth before you into
Galilee; there ye shall see him.&rdquo; (28&nbsp;: 7.) &ldquo;And as
they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them and said, All
hail!&rdquo; (28&nbsp;: 9.) But as the angel had instructed them to go
into Galilee, so also does Jesus give the same command, &ldquo;Go tell
my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see
me.&rdquo; (28&nbsp;: 10.)</p>
<p>Mark gives a very similar account of the woman coming to the tomb
and seeing the &ldquo;young man,&rdquo; who said, &ldquo;Be not
affrighted; ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified; he is
risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him. But go
your way and tell his disciples that he goeth before you into Galilee,
there ye shall see him, as he said unto you.&rdquo; (16&nbsp;: 6,
7.)</p>
<p>The writers of the third and fourth gospels know nothing of any
command to go into Galilee; but on the contrary, Luke relates the
command of Jesus to his disciples to remain where they <i>were</i>
until they should receive blessings from God. &ldquo;Tarry ye in the
city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high.&rdquo;
(24&nbsp;: 49.) Here is manifestly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101"
href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>an entire unconsciousness of
any necessity of the disciples for going into Galilee. For, after
giving this command, Luke goes on to say, &ldquo;He led them out as far
as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. And it came to
pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up
into heaven.&rdquo; (24&nbsp;: 50, 51.)</p>
<p>The two gospels of Mark and Luke make no mention of any journey; but
on the contrary, the immediate ascension of Jesus precludes the
possibility of it. Matthew, who knows nothing of any ascension, gives
this very equivocal statement of the affair: &ldquo;Then the eleven
disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
appointed them, and when they saw him they worshiped him, <i>but some
doubted</i>.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:16-17">28&nbsp;:
16, 17</a>.) But this is too vague; the point which would most interest
us to know is what they doubted and who it was that doubted. Another
equally vague expression is found in the fourth gospel, where it is
related of Peter and John that they went into the sepulcher,
&ldquo;Then went in also that other disciple which came first to the
sepulcher, and they <i>saw</i> and <i>believed</i>&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:8">20&nbsp;:
8</a>); but <i>what</i> they saw and believed is not made plain, except
that they saw an empty tomb, or at least one which contained only the
&ldquo;linen clothes;&rdquo; but what they <i>believed</i> concerning
this empty grave we are not informed. If their belief maintained any
correspondence with what they saw, they believed that they had seen an
empty grave. But our difficulties do not cease; we are surprised that
these early visitors of sepulchers do not see anything of the material
in which Jesus was embalmed. It is recorded that &ldquo;there came also
Nicodemus which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a
mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:39">John
19&nbsp;: 39</a>.)</p>
<p>It is but natural to suppose that if the linen clothes were laid
off, the myrrh and aloes also would be found lying with them, for there
is no probability that Jesus would go abroad <i>a la mummy</i>. We
might ask where the clothes came from that he wore after coming out of
the sepulcher. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102"
name="pb102">102</a>]</span>own garments had been taken by the soldiery
when he died, that the <i>scripture</i> might be <i>fulfilled</i> (?),
but where is the scripture fulfilled which informs us whence came his
resurrection garments? He did not go into society nude, and yet we have
no evidence that any provisions were made for a new suit of clothes.
Some have supposed that when Mary saw him and mistook him for the
gardener her mistake arose from the fact that he may have been clothed
in the garments of the gardener. But how did he get possession of
them?</p>
<p>We must return to the contradictions in regard to the embalmment of
Jesus. Matthew&rsquo;s version excludes the myrrh and aloes. He says,
&ldquo;And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:59-60">27&nbsp;:
59, 60</a>.)</p>
<p>The fourth gospel, as we have seen, relates that when Joseph of
Arimathea and Nicodemus had received the body of Jesus, they embalmed
it in &ldquo;a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound
weight.&rdquo; Mark knows nothing of this, and his account wholly
excludes it. Joseph &ldquo;bought fine linen and took him down and
wrapped him in the linen and laid him in the sepulcher.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2015:46">15&nbsp;:
46</a>.) &ldquo;And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary
the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices that they
might come and anoint him.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:1">16&nbsp;:
1</a>.) If the women came on the third day to embalm the body, they
certainly knew nothing of its embalmment on the day of his death.
Luke&rsquo;s version also excludes the version of the fourth gospel. As
in Mark, so in Luke, they came on the first day of the week to perform
this rite of embalmment. &ldquo;And they [the women] returned and
prepared spices and ointments ... and upon the first day of the week,
very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the
spices which they had prepared.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2023:56">23&nbsp;:
56</a>, and <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:1">24&nbsp;:
1</a>.)</p>
<p>Some <i>exegetes</i> have <i>interpreted</i> this, by saying that
&ldquo;the women came to embalm the body of Jesus, being wholly
ignorant of what Joseph and Nicodemus had done.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>This
might be sufficient if it were not for the fact that the women saw
Jesus after he was put in the tomb. &ldquo;And Mary Magdalene and Mary
the mother of Jesus beheld <i>where</i> he was laid.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2015:47">Mark 15&nbsp;:
47</a>.) Matthew corroborates this: &ldquo;And there was Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:61">27&nbsp;:
61</a>) when Jesus was placed in it.</p>
<p>The obvious meaning of these texts is that they saw him wrapped in
&ldquo;the fine linen&rdquo; and laid away in the tomb. Here, then, are
the contradictory statements. The writer of the fourth gospel relates
how Jesus was embalmed on the day of his death; the writers of the
second and third gospels state that the women came on the third day to
perform this service, wholly unconscious of such embalmment having
taken place on the day of Jesus&rsquo; death; while the writer of the
first gospel knows nothing of the embalmment on the day of his death,
nor of the intended embalmment on the third day. He speaks of the early
visit of the women as coming merely to <i>see</i> the grave. &ldquo;In
the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn, toward the first day of
the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to <i>see</i> the
sepulcher.&rdquo; (28&nbsp;: 1.)</p>
<p>Further contradictions are found in the statements of the writers as
to the <i>time</i> when the women prepared the spices. Mark says
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:11">16&nbsp;:
11</a>), that when the &ldquo;<i>Sabbath</i> was <i>past</i>&rdquo; the
women bought spices with which to anoint the body of Jesus. Luke says
they bought them before the Sabbath; &ldquo;And they returned and
prepared spices and ointments, and rested on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;
(23&nbsp;: 56.)</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are a number of passages in the gospels which
show that Jesus told his disciples over and over again that he should
rise on the third day, and there are other passages which as plainly
show that they had no thought of any such resurrection when the third
day came. If he repeatedly told his followers that he was to be put to
death in Jerusalem and rise again the third day, we must conclude
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>that his disciples would remember his sayings
and that at least some of them would wait for the third day to come,
expecting to see the miracle transpire. But we are astounded to read
over and over again of this &ldquo;rising again the third day,&rdquo;
and yet find no friend remembering or expecting the event when the
third day came. It is urged that Jesus&rsquo; followers did not
understand his words, but this will not meet the case. If several of
these disciples were intelligent enough to write the biography of their
Master they could not have been so stupid as not to understand such
plain words; besides, we must remember that his enemies understood
him.</p>
<p>The Pharisee said to Pilate, &ldquo;Sir, we remember that the
deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate said, &ldquo;Ye have a watch, go your way, make it sure as ye
can.&rdquo; The disciples could not have failed to understand him,
because it was a special effort on the part of Jesus to show that he
must die and rise again on the third day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But their eyes were holden that they should not know
him.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>This miraculous blindness is too irrational to discuss. It is

<p>These teaching are so plain and repeated so often that it is
inconceivable that his disciples should not comprehend his meaning. If
these passages had been as enigmatical as the following, there might
have been some grounds for the claim of ignorance or dullness on the
part of the disciples: &ldquo;For as Jonas was three days and three
nights in the whale&rsquo;s belly, so shall the Son of man be three
days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&rdquo; (<a class=

<h3 class="main">None of the Disciples Looking for a Resurrection.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With these numerous predictions of his resurrection
before us, let us see whether they can be made to harmonize with other
statements on the subject. When immediately after the transfiguration
Jesus warns his disciples not to reveal what they had seen until after
he had risen from the dead, we are told that they questioned among
themselves &ldquo;what <i>rising</i> from the <i>dead</i> should
mean.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%209:2">Mark 9&nbsp;:
2</a>.)</p>
<p>How is it possible that such doubt and surprise could be expressed
by men who had first witnessed the resurrection of Moses and Elias, and
who had also seen the resurrection of the daughter of Jairus, the son
of the widow of Nain and Lazarus!</p>
<p>Now it is plain that if they had ever witnessed these miraculous
resurrections, they could not possibly have wondered &ldquo;what the
rising from the dead should mean.&rdquo; Both statements cannot be
true, for if they thus <i>wondered</i>, it is proof enough that they
had never seen the dead raised to life; and if they did not so express
themselves, then the gospels are unhistorical. That they never queried
in this manner among themselves is evident from the fact that the
resurrection from the dead was at that time a doctrine generally
accepted by the Jews. It is evident that those who undertook the
embalmment of Jesus had no thought of his resurrection within
forty-eight hours. But suppose it conceded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>that
Jesus was deserted by his immediate friends, and his body handed over
to Joseph and Nicodemus, who embalmed it in &ldquo;a mixture of myrrh
and olives about one hundred pound,&rdquo; possibly being ignorant of
the repeated predictions of his resurrection on the third day, which
were made to the disciples; still this is unavailing, as the disciples
are also ignorant of any rising from the dead to take place on the
<i>third day</i>. The women undertook the task of embalming the body of
Jesus, but they seem not to have got fully prepared for the task until
the third day. When his body was taken down from the cross and wrapped
in linen and put in the sepulcher, &ldquo;the women also which came
with him from Galilee followed after, and beheld the sepulcher and how
his body was laid, and they returned and prepared spices and ointments,
and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the
first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the
sepulcher, <i>bringing the spices</i> which they had
<i>prepared</i>.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2023:55-56">Luke
23&nbsp;: 55, 56</a>, and <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>&ldquo;In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the
first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary to
<i>see</i> the <i>sepulcher</i>.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:61">Mat. 27&nbsp;:
61</a>.)</p>
<p>These two writers, while not agreeing on the object of the
women&rsquo;s visiting the sepulcher, nevertheless do agree that they
did not go expecting to see the sepulcher empty.</p>
<p>This early visit was made ostensibly to anoint or embalm the body of
Jesus. Mary Magdalene and the other women did not even dream of a
resurrection&mdash;she did not come expecting to find the tomb empty,
but was concerned to know how they should remove the stone from the
mouth of the tomb. It is evident that if she had heard Jesus say
repeatedly that on the third day after his death he would rise again,
she would not have forgotten it; and if she had, she must have
recollected his predictions when she found the grave empty. In fact she
never once thinks of a resurrection, but when she sees the empty grave,
exclaims, &ldquo;They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>have taken away the Lord out of
the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:2">John
20&nbsp;: 2</a>.)</p>
<p>Luke says that, &ldquo;As the women were much perplexed thereabout,
behold two men stood by them in shining garments, and as they were
afraid, and bowed themselves to the earth [people usually run away when
they are frightened] they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among
the dead? He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke unto you
when he was yet in Galilee, saying: The Son of man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
again. And they remembered his words.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:5-8">Luke
24&nbsp;: 5&ndash;8</a>.)</p>
<p>This is evidently an afterthought, an effort to fill out an
imperfect record, but the patch is too perceptible; for had it been
that the women needed only to have their memory jogged to recollect the
prediction of Jesus concerning his rising from the dead on the third
day, we may infer that a similar reminder would refresh the memory of
the eleven, but on the contrary they scouted the idea of such a thing.
The women &ldquo;returned from the sepulcher and told all these things
unto the eleven, and the rest ... And their words seemed to them as
idle tales, and they believed them <i>not</i>.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:9-11">24&nbsp;: 9,
11</a>.)</p>
<p>Mark also says that the eleven did not believe the story of Mary
Magdalene: &ldquo;She went out and told them that had been with him, as
they mourned and wept. And they, when they had heard that he was alive,
and had been seen of her, <i>believed not</i>.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:10-11">16&nbsp;:
10, 11</a>.)</p>
<p>They also had not so much as a dream of the resurrection of Jesus.
They were not waiting and watching for the third day to come that they
might see the predictions of Jesus fulfilled and their hearts filled to
overflowing with joy at the sight. They were not at the sepulcher, as
we might naturally expect. True, it was not too early for the women
impelled by human love to be there with ointments and spices; but the
eleven who were baptized with heavenly love (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:22">John 20&nbsp;:
22</a>), entertained not the first thought of visiting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>the
grave. And even when the marvelous scenes witnessed by the women are
clearly stated to the eleven who had heard him teach that he must go up
to Jerusalem and be killed and the third day rise again&mdash;who had
heard this teaching and prediction repeatedly and openly, and in the
plainest language, and yet did not believe anything in it or in the
report of the women&mdash;all this is simply incredible. We are forced
to conclude that if they were not at the tomb on the third day, and
scouted the story of the women&mdash;for &ldquo;their words seemed to
them as idle tales&rdquo;&mdash;they had never once heard Jesus say he
would rise from the dead on the third day.</p>
<p>Luke says, that of the eleven only Peter went to the sepulcher, and
that stooping down &ldquo;he saw the linen clothes laid by themselves,
and departed wondering in himself at that which had come to
pass.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:12">24&nbsp;:
12</a>.)</p>
<p>He wonders, but expresses no thought of a resurrection. The writer
of the fourth gospel contradicts Luke in saying that there were two
persons who went to the sepulcher on that occasion. &ldquo;Peter
therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the
sepulcher.... Then went in also that other disciple, which came first
to the sepulcher, and he saw and believed. For as yet they knew not the
Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:3-10">John
20&nbsp;: 3, 9, 10</a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw and believed,&rdquo; but we are not told <i>what</i>
he believed. He did not certainly believe in the resurrection of Jesus.
&ldquo;For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise
again.&rdquo; This passage is plainly legendary. It belongs to a later
age when the dogma began to control the minds of Christians; for it is
true that the early Christians did not insist so much upon the evidence
of miracles as they did upon the prophecies. It must have been written
long after that time, for it is not the &ldquo;scriptures&rdquo; they
needed to <i>know</i> to be informed concerning his resurrection, but
the plain language of Jesus which he had with special effort, and in an
open manner uttered in their ears but a few days before. It was wholly
needless for them to know the scriptures <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>in order to recollect
these prophetic predictions. Regard these statements as we may, they
are certainly unhistorical. For if Jesus so frequently spoke of his
death and subsequent resurrection, then it is certain that they would
have remembered his words, and if they had not cherished them with
faith, yet when they had heard from the women of the empty grave, they
would without doubt, have recalled his predictions, and claimed their
fulfillment. But they do no such thing. They said of the women&rsquo;s
story what was probably true, that &ldquo;their words seemed to them as
idle tales, and [therefore] they believed them not.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Evidence of Paul on the Resurrection of
Jesus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He gives his testimony in this form: &ldquo;For I
delivered unto you first of all that which I also <i>received</i>, that
Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and was buried,
and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. And
that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. After that he was seen
of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain
unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that he was seen
by James, then by all the Apostles. And last of all he was seen of me
also, as of one born out of due time.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:4-8">1 Cor.
15&nbsp;: 4&ndash;8</a>.)</p>
<p>In this statement Paul does not pretend to have witnessed the event
himself, but preaches it as a doctrine which he had
&ldquo;received.&rdquo; He speaks of it as a tradition, &ldquo;that
Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was
buried, and that he rose again the third day <i>according to the
Scriptures</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This language betrays the influence of the dogma of a later date;
for the writer in speaking of the five hundred by whom Jesus was said
to have been seen says, &ldquo;of whom the greater part remain unto
this present [day] but some are fallen asleep.&rdquo; &ldquo;Unto this
present&rdquo; [day] shows that the writer is making his record long
after the event. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paul wrote probably about twenty-five years after the date of the
events he records. And the writers of the gospels also wrote at a late
date. Matthew says, &ldquo;And this saying is commonly reported among
the Jews <i>until this day</i>.&rdquo; (28&nbsp;: 15.)</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;until this day&rdquo; points out the fact that the
gospel records were not completed until long after the time of their
occurrence. In addition to this, there were many gospels recording the
life and doings of Jesus. &ldquo;Forasmuch as <i>many</i> have taken in
hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most
surely believed among us.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:1">Luke 1&nbsp;:
1</a>.) &ldquo;<i>Believed</i> among us&rdquo;&mdash;he did not
<i>know</i>, but merely <i>believed</i> these things. Now suppose we
had these other gospels, what harmony could we expect to find among the
imaginary five hundred if they had left a record of what was
&ldquo;most surely <i>believed</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was seen by Cephas.&rdquo; It is significant of
Paul&rsquo;s independence, that while the writers of the four gospels
all explicitly declare that Jesus first appeard to Mary Magdalene, Paul
knows nothing of such an appearance. That he makes no mention of this
first appearance of Jesus is evidence that he wrote independently of
others, as he said he did, and also that he wrote before the
evangelists wrote. He had no honors to bestow upon women, as his
writings show, and if he had ever heard of this appearance to Mary
Magdalene, he concluded that it was &ldquo;an idle tale.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:11">Luke
24&nbsp;: 11</a>.)</p>
<p>It is noticeable also that although this doctrine is
&ldquo;received&rdquo; as a prediction of the scriptures, yet no one is
recorded in either of the gospels or writings of Paul as having seen
Jesus rise from the sepulcher. Even though it is affirmed that Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary had seen the angel from heaven <i>roll
back the stone</i> from the mouth of the sepulcher, yet they did not
witness any resurrection.</p>
<p>All that Paul &ldquo;received&rdquo; on this subject was the current
traditions. As a Pharisee, he believed in the doctrine of a general
resurrection, and it was most natural for him to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>accept such tradition into his belief. That he
wrote under the influence of a later age, when the dogma began to
assume character, is manifest in the recourse he has to scripture
evidences. &ldquo;And that he rose again the third day <i>according</i>
to the <i>Scriptures</i>.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:4">1 Cor.
15&nbsp;: 4</a>.) But the passages usually cited as proof-predictions
that Jesus should rise from the dead, when examined, cannot be regarded
as Messianic at all; for the idea of a <i>suffering</i> Messiah was
wholly foreign to the Jewish mind. The scriptures usually cited are

<p>As illustrating the free use made of the scriptures, we have only to

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2012:40">Matthew
12&nbsp;: 40</a> with parallel passages of Mark and Luke. Mark
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%208:11">8&nbsp;:
11</a>), says, &ldquo;And the Pharisees came forth and began to
question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. And
he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith, Why doth this generation seek
after a sign? Verily I say unto you, there shall no sign be given unto
this generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2011:29-31">11&nbsp;:
29&ndash;31</a>) states that &ldquo;when the people were gathered thick
together, he began to say, This is an evil generation; they seek a
sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the
prophet. For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall the Son
of man be to this generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew gives two versions of this incident, &ldquo;A wicked and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall be no sign
but the sign of the prophet Jonas.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016:4">16&nbsp;:
4</a>.) &ldquo;Certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he answered and said
unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and
there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale&rsquo;s belly
so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of
the earth.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2012:38-41">Mat.
12&nbsp;: 38&ndash;41</a>.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here it will be observed is an illustration of the growth of the
dogma and myth in adding this reference to Jonas. And it is highly
significant that the application of the myth of Jonas is wholly
fanciful, as the passage referred to (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jon%201:17">Jonah 1&nbsp;:
17</a>.) has not the <span class="corr" id="xd21e2570" title=
"Source: slighest">slightest</span> character of prophecy. That the
scriptures are evidently tortured is obvious from the fact that Jesus
was only one day and two nights in the heart of the earth, and, as
before said, the passage is not prophetic; besides, its varied form in
the gospels plainly shows it to be a myth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve, and after that he
was seen by above five hundred brethren at once.&rdquo; But there were
only <i>eleven</i> Apostles until after the ascension, when Matthias
was elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Judas.
&ldquo;And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias;
and he was numbered with the <i>eleven</i> apostles.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:26">Acts 1&nbsp;:
26</a>.)</p>
<p>This election of Matthias took place after the ascension. He could
not therefore have been seen by the &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; <i>after</i>
his <i>ascension</i> (and there were not twelve until after the
ascension), only by the &ldquo;eye of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Jesus was seen by above five hundred is nothing more than naked
statement. Paul does not claim to have been one of that number. This
episode, moreover, is not mentioned in any of the four gospels. It is
remarkable that so great an event should be passed over by other
writers also, for not a trace of it can be found elsewhere. It is
difficult for us to understand how this marvelous scene could so
completely perish out of sight of all writers except one who was not
present, but merely heard of it afterward. That Paul may have believed
the story we do not deny&mdash;and that he believed that the greater
part of the witnesses &ldquo;remain unto this present&rdquo; time. Now
if these survivors remained he does not mention the names of any of
them. And besides, they were not within reach of the Corinthians who
might wish to hear and investigate their testimony, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>for
the Corinthians did not accept the resurrection of Jesus as a matter of
fact.</p>
<p>How could five hundred disciples come together immediately at one
time, when some time after the ascension the number of disciples at
Jerusalem was only one hundred and twenty? (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:15">Acts 1&nbsp;:
15</a>.)</p>
<p>We need to know something of the character of those who gave Paul
this information, and the sources of their knowledge. For it is
all-important to our inquiry to know from whom Paul <i>received</i>
these traditions and what evidences his informants had of the truth of
the story they told. To believe in the reality of these appearances
simply because Paul states that he has &ldquo;received&rdquo; his
information from others and believes it to be true, without inquiring
as to the character of his informers, is the blindest credulity. Who
were the five hundred? What did they think of the event? How did Paul
or any other person know what they thought, if there were no written
statements by them? Where and when did the five hundred see the risen
Jesus?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last of all he was seen by me.&rdquo; In another place he
says, &ldquo;Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%209:1">1 Cor.
9&nbsp;: 1</a>.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere he relates: &ldquo;But when he was pleased, God, who
separated me from my mother&rsquo;s womb, and called me through his
grace to reveal his son in me, that I might preach him among the
heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, but I went
into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:15-17">Gal.
1&nbsp;: 15&ndash;17</a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;For neither did I receive it from men nor was taught it, but
through the <i>revelation</i> of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:11">Gal. 1&nbsp;:
11</a>.) We shall find as we proceed that Paul saw Jesus
<i>subjectively</i>. It is quite natural to so understand his words,
&ldquo;reveal his son in me.&rdquo; Especially does this seem obvious
when we remember that Paul was a man who firmly believed in visions and
revelations. In relating his own experience he states this fact
plainly. &ldquo;I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago
(whether in the body I cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>tell&mdash;God knoweth), such
a one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man (whether in
the body or out of the body, I cannot tell&mdash;God knoweth) how that
he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is
not lawful for man to utter. Of such an one will I glory.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%2012:2-4">2
Cor. 12&nbsp;: 2&ndash;4</a>.)</p>
<p>In Acts there are three contradictory accounts of his seeing Jesus
in a vision. &ldquo;And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and
suddenly there shined round about him a <i>light</i> from
<i>heaven</i>. And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto
him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou,
Lord? And the Lord said I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest: it is hard
for thee to kick against the pricks. And he, trembling and astonished,
said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him,
Arise, and go into the city, and it will be told thee what thou must
do. And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
voice, but seeing no man.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:3-7">Acts
9&nbsp;: 3&ndash;7</a>.)</p>
<p>A second version is in this form: &ldquo;And it came to pass that as
I made my journey and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly
there shone from heaven a great light round about me. And I fell unto
the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said
unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. And they that
were with me <i>saw</i> indeed the <i>light</i> and were afraid, but
they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me. And I said, Lord,
what wilt thou have me do? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go
into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all the things which
are appointed for thee to do.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022:6-10">Acts
22&nbsp;: 6&ndash;10</a>.)</p>
<p>The third account of the affair is given thus: &ldquo;Whereupon as I
went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
at mid-day, O king, I saw in the way alight from heaven, above the
brightness of the sun, shining round about me. And when we were all
fallen to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, saying,
in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard
for thee to kick against the pricks. And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
And he said, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest....
Whereupon, O king, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
<i>vision</i>.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:9-19">Acts
26&nbsp;: 9&ndash;19</a>.)</p>
<p>According to the first account the companions of Paul
&ldquo;<i>stood</i> speechless&rdquo; (9&nbsp;: 7); in the third they
&ldquo;<i>all fall</i> to the <i>earth</i>.&rdquo; (26&nbsp;: 14.) Then
again, in the first account it is said that the men &ldquo;stood
speechless, <i>hearing</i> the <i>voice</i>, but seeing no one.&rdquo;
In the second it is stated that &ldquo;they that were with me saw
indeed the light, but they <i>heard not</i> the voice.&rdquo; These
contradictions do not seem to clothe the vision of Paul with the
acceptable form of harmony.</p>
<p>It will be observed that even in this <i>vision</i> Paul is not
described as <i>seeing</i> Jesus. He <i>sees</i> a <i>light</i> and
falls to the ground, and when he rises he is blind. &ldquo;And they led
him by the hand and brought him to Damascus. And he was three days
without sight.&rdquo; (9&nbsp;: 8.)</p>
<p>In the continuation of this account Paul has another vision:
&ldquo;And it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem,
even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance, and saw him
saying unto me, Make haste and get thee out of Jerusalem.&rdquo;
(22&nbsp;: 17, 18.)</p>
<p>In connection with these visions and revelations it is highly
significant that Paul never claims to have seen Jesus in the flesh, and
he never speaks of the resurrection as material, but as spiritual.
&ldquo;It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:44">1
Cor. 15&nbsp;: 44</a>.) &ldquo;Who shall change our vile bodies that it
may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil%203:21">Phil.
3&nbsp;: 21</a>.) Evidently there <i>is no claim</i> for seeing Jesus
<i>in the body</i> made by <i>Paul</i> in any of his writings. He
preaches the doctrine of the resurrection, but this doctrine he, as a
Pharisee, believed before he became a Christian. Paul claims that in a
vision he saw Jesus. Luke says that this was also the manner in which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>Mary Magdalene and the other women saw Jesus.
&ldquo;And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they
had also seen a <i>vision</i> of angels, which said that he was
alive.&rdquo; (24&nbsp;: 2, 3.)</p>
<p>This gives force to the claim of Paul, that his seeing or
<i>vision</i> of Jesus was of the same class as the visions of all the
others who had seen him.</p>
<p>Thus, after a careful examination of the writings attributed to the
immediate followers of Jesus, we find that not one of them says,
&ldquo;I saw Jesus rise from the grave;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I saw Jesus in
the flesh after his resurrection.&rdquo; In legendary style it is
frequently repeated that he &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; first to this and
then to that one, but there is not the slightest evidence that any one
saw him. And in this connection it is worthy of remark that Jesus did
not appear to any persons except his friends. This gives better
occasion for suspicion that the story is mythical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly, not
to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us
who did eat and drink with him.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:41">Acts
10&nbsp;: 41</a>.) To appear to a few private friends for <i>one
day</i> does not seem much like bringing life and immortality to light
to the whole world. The method is too narrow and exclusive. And even of
these few friends not one has left the record for us of what he saw.
The writers who have recorded the current traditions of their time,
agree in saying that Mary Magdalene found the grave empty: further than
this the writers do not corroborate one another.</p>
<p>How soon the resurrection of the physical body became popular we
have no means of knowing. It was not certainly until some time after
the writings of Paul were given to the churches, for he, as we have
seen, speaks, of it as a <i>spiritual</i> resurrection. So also does
Peter (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pt%203:13">1 Peter
3&nbsp;: 13</a>), speak of Jesus &ldquo;being slain in the flesh, but
made alive again in the <i>spirit</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legend became more and more marvelous as it spread abroad.
Enthusiasm inflamed the minds of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>ignorant and
superstitious until the subjective visions of Paul became crystalized
into objective realities. His visions, and the visions, revelations and
messages of the angels of others were reduced in popular belief to
historical facts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. No one of the four gospels is mentioned in any
other part of the New Testament. [This assuredly would not have been
the case had they been the oldest, and the foundation on which the
whole was built.]</p>
<p>2. No work of art of any kind has ever been discovered, no painting
or engraving, no sculpture or other relic of antiquity which may be
looked upon as furnishing additional evidence of the existence of those
gospels, and which was executed earlier than the latter part of the
second century. Even the explorations of the Christian catacombs failed
to bring to light any evidence of that character.</p>
<p>3. The four gospels were written in Greek, and there was no
translation of them into other languages earlier than the third
century.</p>
<p>4. No manuscript of the gospels are in existence dating further back
than the fourth century. Of that century, or the next, there are three
or four, and some twenty or thirty, more than a thousand years old.</p>
<p>5. No autograph manuscript of any of the gospels has ever been
known, so far as there is any authentic record, nor has any credible
witness ever claimed to have seen such a manuscript. No one has ever
claimed to have seen such a manuscript of either of the four gospels in
the hand-writing of Luke, Mark, Matthew, or John. If the autograph
manuscripts had ever existed they would have been preserved among the
most sacred relics of the church. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120"
href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. During the first two centuries tradition was esteemed of more
value and better evidence of the gospel history, than any written books
or manuscripts.</p>
<p>7. The dialect in which the New Testament books were written, a sort
of Hebraistic Greek, has been considered evidence of their antiquity.
But this dialect prevailed three centuries after Christ, and was in
full use during the second century. The same or similar Hebraisms
abound in the apocryphal gospels of that age.</p>
<p>8. The canonical gospels were selected by the bishops from a large
number then in circulation.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In taking a general review of the first hundred and seventy years of
the Christian religion the first thing that strikes the mind is the
dearth of material from which to construct a reliable history. It is
seen at once how much must rest upon probability in its different
degrees&mdash;how much must be relegated to the province of
speculation. The works of the only church historian who wrote during
that period, lost or destroyed the few fragments that are left being of
comparatively no value&mdash;the writings of Porphyry and others who
wrote against Christianity, and those of the heretic Christians, all
destroyed&mdash;there remain only the works of some of the orthodox
fathers, and the text of those in a mutilated and corrupted
condition.</p>
<p>Such is the material at the hands of the historian. Of course he
cannot rely implicitly upon the unsupported assertion of any such
writer for the truth of any historical fact whatever. In every instance
he is obliged to scrutinize carefully, and endeavor to ascertain
whether any ulterior motives may have prompted whatever statement may
be under consideration. If he can find none, and the fact stands
uncontradicted by other writers, it is cautiously accepted. Under such
circumstances progress is slow and uncertain. The most that any writer
can hope to accomplish is to place in proper shape what is already
known, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>and to establish here and there a landmark for
the benefit of subsequent historians.</p>
<p>In conclusion, as the result of this investigation, it may be
repeated that no evidence is found of the existence in the first
century of either of the following doctrines: the immaculate
conception&mdash;the miracles of Christ&mdash;the material
resurrection. No one of these gospels is found in the epistles of the
New Testament, nor have we been able to find them in other writings of
the first century.</p>
<p>As to the four gospels, in coming to the conclusion that they were
not written in the first century, we have but recorded the conviction
of the most advanced scholars of the present day, irrespective of their
religious views in other respects; with whom as now presented, is, How
early in the second century were they composed<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2789" title="Source: .">?</span> Discarding as inventions of the
second century, having no historical foundation, the three doctrines
above named, and much else which must necessarily stand or fall with
them, what remains of the Christian religion? (C. B. Waite,

uncritical age and rocked with traditional ease. Conscientious care was
not directed from the first to the well authenticated testimony of
eye-witnesses. Of the three fathers who contributed most to its early
growth, Iren&aelig;us was credulous and blundering; Tertullian
passionate and one-sided; and Clement, of Alexandria, imbued with the
treasures of Greek wisdom, was mainly occupied with ecclesiastical
ethics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iren&aelig;us agrees that the gospels should be four in
number, neither more nor less, because there are four universal winds
and four quarters of the world. The Word or Architect of all things
gave the gospel in a four-fold shape. According to this father the
apostles were fully informed concerning all things, and had a perfect
knowledge after their Lord&rsquo;s ascension. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He says, &lsquo;Matthew wrote his gospels while Peter and
Paul were preaching in Rome, and founding the church.&rsquo; Such
assertions show both ignorance and exaggeration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tertullian affirms that the tradition of the apostolic
churches guarantees the four gospels, and refers his readers to the
churches of Corinth, Philippi, Ephesus, etc., for the authentic
epistles of Paul. What is this but the rhetoric of an enthusiast?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clement contradicts himself in making Peter authorize
Mark&rsquo;s gospel to be read in the churches, while in another place
he says the apostles &lsquo;neither forbade nor encouraged
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three fathers of whom we are speaking had neither the
ability nor inclination to examine the genesis of documents surrounded
with an apostolic halo. No analysis of their authenticity and
genuineness was seriously attempted. In its absence, custom, accident,
taste, practical needs, directed the tendency of tradition. All the
rhetoric employed to throw the value of their testimony as far back as
possible, even up to or very near to the apostle John, is of the
vaguest sort. Appeals to the continuity of tradition and of church
doctrine, to the exceptional veneration of these fathers for the
gospels, to their opinions being formed earlier than the composition of
the works in which they are expressed, possess no force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ends which the fathers in question had in view, their
polemic motives, their uncritical, inconsistent assertions, their want
of sure data, detract from their testimony. Their decisions were much
more the result of pious feeling, biased by the theological
speculations of the times, than the conclusions of a sound judgment.
The <i>very arguments</i> they use to establish certain conclusions
show <i>weakness</i> of perception. What are the manifestations of
spiritual feeling compared with the result of logical reasoning?&rdquo;
(Davidson on the Canon.)</p>
<p>Thus we have the testimony of one of the ablest and clearest minds
that has ever written upon the canon which <span class=

pious feeling based upon [incorrect] theological speculations;&rdquo;
&ldquo;unsound judgment;&rdquo; &ldquo;weakness of perception;&rdquo;
&ldquo;lack of logical reasoning.&rdquo; These are the characteristics
of the fathers depended upon to establish the authenticity of a gospel
story which has no solid foundation to rest upon and which is clearly
of an apocryphal character. (&ldquo;Answers to Christian
Questions&rdquo; pp. 69&ndash;70, by D. M. Bennett.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and seventy years from the coming of Christ
elapsed before the collection assumed a form that carried with it the
idea of <i>holy</i> and inspired.&rdquo; (Davidson on the Canon, p.
106.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear that the earliest church fathers did not use the
books of the New Testament as sacred documents clothed with divine
authority, but followed for the most part, at least till the middle of
the second century, apostolic tradition orally transmitted.&rdquo;
(Ibid, p. 107.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their decisions (the fathers) were much more the result of
pious feeling biased by the theological speculations of the times, than
the conclusions of a sound judgment. The very arguments they use to
establish certain conclusions show weakness of perception.&rdquo; (Ibid
p. 124.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men who first canonized them (the gospels) had no
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2835" title=

(Ibid p. 127.)</p>

p. 25.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=

<p>&ldquo;The canon was not the work of the Christian Church so much as
of the men who were striving to form the church.&rdquo; (Ibid p.
129.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Davidson says that the Gospel of Matthew, as we
have it now could not have been written by Matthew. Intro. New Test. 1,
p. 484. He says that the present Gospel of Mark was not written by Mark
and that its author is unknown.&rdquo; (Ibid 2, p. 83, 84.)</p>
<p>Of John&rsquo;s Gospel he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its existence before 140 A. D. is incapable either of
decision or probable showing. The Johannine authorship has receded
before the tide of modern criticism, and though this tide is arbitrary
at times, it is here irresistible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No certain traces of the existence of the fourth gospel can
be found till after Justin Martyr, that is till after the middle of the
second century.&rdquo; (Ibid 2, p. 520.)</p>

<h3 class="main">Ignorance and Dishonesty of the Early Fathers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the charge of <i>ignorance</i> justly attaches to
many of the fathers of the church, and that of <i>dishonesty</i> as
well, there is abundant evidence, but a small portion of this can be
given here. Mosheim, in part 2 chapter 3 of his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical
History,&rdquo; says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interest of virtue and true religion suffered yet more
grievously by the monstrous errors that were universally adopted in
this century, and became a source of innumerable calamities and
mischiefs of succeeding ages. The first of these maxims was <i>that it
was an act of virtue to deceive and lie</i> when by that means the
interest of the church might be promoted; and the second, equally
horrible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>though in another point of view, was &ldquo;that
errors in religion, when maintained and adhered to after proper
admonition were punishable with civil penalties and corporal
tortures.&rdquo; The former of these erroneous maxims was now of long
standing. It had been adopted for long ages past, and had produced an
incredible number of ridiculous fables, fictitious prodigies, and pious
frauds to the remarkable detriment to that glorious cause in which they
were employed. And it must be frankly confessed that the greatest men
and the most eminent saints of this century [the fourth] were more or
less tainted with the infection of this corrupt principle, as will
appear evident to such as look with an attentive eye to their writings
and actions. We would willingly except from this charge Ambrose, and
Hiliary Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen, and Jerome; but truth, which is
more respectable than these venerable fathers, obliges us to involve
them in the general accusation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time he says, as translated by Vidal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time when he [Hermas] wrote, it was an established
maxim with many Christians to avail themselves of fraud and deception,
if it was likely they would conduce toward the attainment of any
considerable good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He again says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was considered that they who made it their business to
deceive, with a view of promoting the cause of truth, were deserving
rather of commendation than censure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The French Protestant writer, Casaubon, talks in a similar way,
thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It mightily affects me to see how many there were in the
earliest times of the church who considered it a capital exploit to
lend to heavenly truth the help of their own inventions in order that
the new doctrine might be received by the wise among the Gentiles.
These officious lies, they said, were devised for a good
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Le Clerc, corroborating these opinions, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissemblers of truth are nowhere to be met with in such
abundance as among the writers of church history.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>M. Daille, another learned and impartial French writer, in his
celebrated work, the &ldquo;Use of the Fathers,&rdquo; says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We find them saying things which they did not themselves
believe. They are mutually witnesses against each other, that they are
not to be believed absolutely on their bare word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In book 1, chapter 6, he states upon the authority of St. Jerome,
that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Origin, Methodius, Eusebius, Apollonaris, have written
largely against Celsus and Porphyry. Do but observe their manner of
arguing, and what slippery problems they used. They alleged against the
Gentiles, not what they believed, but what they thought
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerome himself adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbear mentioning the Latin writers, as Tertullian,
Cyprian, Minutius, Victorinus, Lactantius, Hiliary, lest I should
rather seem to accuse others than defend myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daille adds of the fathers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made no scruple to forge whole books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An able writer in the Eclectic Review of 1814, page 179, speaks of
the fathers in this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we consider the number of gospels, acts, epistles,
revelations, traditions, and constitutions which were put in
circulation during the first three centuries, and which are
unquestionably spurious, we find sufficient reason for examining with
care and receiving with extreme caution productions attributed to
eminent men in the primitive church. Some of the early Christians do
not seem to have possessed in some points a nice sense of moral
obligation. The writing of books under false names, and the circulating
of fables, were not accounted violations of duty; or, if the
impropriety of such conduct was felt, the end proposed&mdash;the
promotion of the Christian cause&mdash;was thought to justify the means
employed for the accomplishment. (From D. M. Bennett&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Answers to Christian Questions,&rdquo; p. 78&ndash;80.)

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following very pertinent argument is made use of
by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould in his &ldquo;Lost and Hostile
Gospels&rdquo;: &ldquo;It is somewhat remarkable that no contemporary,
or even early account of the life of our Lord exists, except from the
pen of Christian writers. That we have none by Greek or Roman writers
is not, perhaps, to be wondered at; but it is singular that neither
Philo, Josephus, nor Justus of Tiberius, should ever have alluded to
Christ or to primitive Christianity. Philo was born at Alexandria about
twenty years before Christ. In the year A. D. 40 he was sent by the
Alexandrian Jews on a mission to Caligula, to entreat the emperor not
to put in force his order that his statue should be erected in the
temple of Jerusalem and in all the synagogues of the Jews. Philo was a
Pharisee. He traveled in Palestine, and speaks of the Essenes he saw
there; but he says not a word about Jesus Christ or his followers. It
is possible that he may have heard of the new sect, but he probably
concluded it was but insignificant, and consisted merely of the
disciples, poor and ignorant, of a Galilean rabbi, whose doctrines he,
perhaps did not stay to inquire into, and supposed they did not differ
fundamentally from the traditional teaching of the rabbis of his
day.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Spurious Passage in Josephus.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;At this time lived Jesus, a wise man [if indeed
he ought to be called a man]; for he performed wonderful works [he was
a teacher of men who received the truth with gladness]; and he drew to
him many Jews and also many Greeks. [This was the Christ.] But when
Pilate, at the instigation of our chiefs, had condemned him to
crucifixion, they who at first loved him did not cease; [for he
appeared to them on the third day again; for the divine prophets had
foretold this, together with many other wonderful things concerning
him], and even to this time the community of Christians called after
him, continues to exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this passage is <i>spurious</i> has been almost universally
acknowledged. One may be accused perhaps of killing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>dead
birds, if one again examines and discredits the passage; but as the
silence of Josephus on the subject which we are treating is a point on
which it will be necessary to insist, we cannot omit as brief a
discussion as possible of the celebrated passage.</p>
<p>The passage is first quoted by Eusebius (fl. A. D. 315) in two
places (Hist. Eccl. lib. 1. c. 11; Demonst. Evang. lib. 3.), but it was
unknown to Justin Martyr (fl. A. D. 140<a id="xd21e2932" name=
"xd21e2932"></a>), Clement of Alexandria (fl. A. D. 192), Tertullian
(fl. A. D. 193), and Origen (fl. A. D. 230<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2934" title="Source: .)">).</span> Such a testimony would
certainly have been produced by Justin in his apology, or in his
controversy with Trypho the Jew, had it existed in the copies of
Josephus at his time. The silence of Origen is still more significant.
Celsus in his book against Christianity introduces a Jew. Origen
attacks the arguments of Celsus and his Jew. He could not have failed
to quote the words of Josephus, whose writings he knew, had the passage
existed in the genuine text. He indeed distinctly affirms that Josephus
did not believe in Christ. (Contra. Celsus 1.)</p>
<p>Again the paragraph interrupts the chain of ideas in the original
text. Before this passage comes an account of how Pilate, seeing there
was a want of pure drinking water in Jerusalem, conducted a stream into
the city from a spring two hundred stadia distant, and ordered that the
cost should be defrayed out of the treasury of the Temple. This
occasioned a riot. Pilate disguised Roman soldiers as Jews, with swords
under their cloaks, and sent them among the rabble, with orders to
arrest the ringleaders. This was done. The Jews finding themselves set
upon by other Jews, fell into confusion; one Jew attacked another, and
the whole company of rioters melted away. &ldquo;And in this
manner,&rdquo; says Josephus, &ldquo;was this insurrection
suppressed.&rdquo; Then follows the paragraph about Jesus, beginning,
&ldquo;At this time lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to
call him a man,&rdquo; etc., and the passage is immediately followed
by, &ldquo;About this time another misfortune threw the Jews into
disturbance; and in Rome an event happened in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>temple of Isis which produced great
scandal.&rdquo; And then he tells an indelicate story of religious
deception which need not be repeated here. The misfortune which befell
the Jews was, as he afterward relates, that Tiberius drove them out of
Rome. The reason of this was, he says, that a noble Roman lady who had
become a proselyte, had sent gold and purple to the temple at
Jerusalem. But this reason is not sufficient. It is clear from what
precedes&mdash;a story of sacerdotal fraud&mdash;that there was some
connection between the incidents in the mind of Josephus. Probably the
Jews had been guilty of religious deceptions in Rome, and had made a
business of performing cures and expelling demons, with talismans, and
incantations, and for this had obtained rich payment.</p>
<p>From the connection that exists between the passage about the
&ldquo;other misfortune which befell the Jews,&rdquo; and the former
one about the riot suppressed by Pilate, it appears evident that the
whole of the paragraph concerning our Lord is an interpolation. That
Josephus could not have written the passage as it stands, is clear
enough, for only a Christian would speak of Jesus in the terms
employed. Josephus was a Pharisee and a Jewish priest; he shows in all
his writings that he believes in Judaism.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that Josephus may have written about Christ as
in the passage quoted, but that the portions within brackets are the
interpolations of a Christian copyist. But when these portions within
brackets are removed, the passage loses all its interest and is a dry
statement utterly unlike the sort of notice Josephus would have been
likely to insert. He gives color to his narratives; his incidents are
always sketched with vigor; this account would be meagre besides those
of the riot of the Jews and the rascality of the priests of Isis.
Josephus asserts, moreover, that in his time there were four sects
among the Jews&mdash;the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, and the
sect of Judas of Gamala. He gives tolerably copious particulars about
these sects, and their teachings, but of the Christian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>sect
he says not a word. Had he wished to write about it, he would have
given full details, likely to interest his readers, and not have
dismissed the subject in a couple of lines.</p>
<p>It was perhaps felt by the early Christians that the silence of
Josephus, so famous a historian and a Jew, on the life, miracles, and
death of the founder of Christianity was extremely inconvenient; the
fact could not fail to be noticed by their adversaries. Some Christian
transcriber may have argued, either Josephus knew nothing of the
miracles performed by Christ&mdash;in which case he is a weighty
testimony against them&mdash;or he must have heard of Jesus, but not
having deemed his acts, as they were related to him, of sufficient
importance to find a place in history. Arguing thus, the copyist took
the opportunity of rectifying the omission, written from the stand
point of a Pharisee, and therefore designated the Lord as merely a wise
man. (D. M. Bennett in &ldquo;Jesus Christ.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>That this paragraph, concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, is not
Josephus&rsquo;s but an interpolation, is argued from these several
following considerations:</p>
<p>1. It is not quoted or referred to by any Christian writer before
Eusebius, who flourished at the beginning of the fourth century, and
afterward.</p>
<p>2. This paragraph was wanting in the copies of Josephus which were
seen by Photius, in the ninth century.</p>
<p>3. It interrupts the course of the narration.</p>
<p>4. It is unsuitable to the general character of Josephus, who is
allowed not to have been a Christian.</p>
<p>5. If Josephus were the author of this paragraph, it would be
reasonable to expect in him frequent mention of Christ&rsquo;s
miracles; whereas he is everywhere else silent about them.</p>
<p>6. The word Christ or Messiah appears not in any place in all the
works of Josephus, excepting two; namely, the paragraph which we have
been considering, which is now in the eighteenth book of his
Antiquities; and another in the twentieth book of the name Antiquities
where is mention <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>made of James, the brother Jesus who is
called &lsquo;Christ.&rsquo; (Works of N. Lardner, vol. 7, pp. 14,
15.)</p>

<h3 class="main">EUSEBIUS.</h3>
<h3 class="main">The Father of Church History.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In referring to his work of writing a history of the
church up to his own times, he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are attempting a kind of trackless and unbeaten
path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he says of Philo Jud&aelig;us that he was a very
&ldquo;learned man.&rdquo; Among many other things which contradict
this estimate, is the fact that Philo takes more than one hundred pages
in showing how that dreams are sent from God.</p>
<p>Again, Eusebius does not say that the last works of Hegesippus,
Papias and Dionysius of Corinth, contain anything concerning the
canonical gospels; therefore, they contained none.</p>
<p>We give the opinion of a few well-known writers upon this
&ldquo;father of church history&rdquo;:</p>
<p>In Draper&rsquo;s Intellectual Development of Europe, p. 197, Bunsen
and Niebuhr are quoted&mdash;the one (Bunsen) as saying that he
purposely &ldquo;perverted chronology for the sake of making
synchronisms,&rdquo; and the other (Niebuhr) declaring &ldquo;he is a
very dishonest writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eusebius had a peculiar faculty of diverging from the
truth.&rdquo; (&ldquo;History of Christian Religion,&rdquo; p. 7.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius,
himself, indirectly confesses that he has related whatever might
redound to the glory, and has suppressed all that could tend to the
disgrace of religion.&rdquo; (Gibbon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rome,&rdquo; vol.
1, p. 493.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the most learned and elaborate works that antiquity
has left us, the thirty-second chapter of the twelfth book of his
evangelical preparation, bears for its title this scandalous
proposition: &lsquo;How it may be lawful <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>and fitting to use
falsehood as a medicine and for the benefit of those who want to be
deceived.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Gibbon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vindication,&rdquo; p.
76.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Eusebius, the father of church history, capped the climax
by fabricating the celebrated passage about &ldquo;Jesus, a wise man,
if it be lawful to call him such.&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Anti-Christ,<span class="corr" id="xd21e2994" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> p. 28.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He (Eusebius) has frankly told us that his principle in
writing history was to conceal the facts that were injurious to the
reputation of the church.&rdquo; (Lecky&rsquo;s &ldquo;European
Morals,&rdquo; vol. 1, p. 492.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eusebius, who would never lie or falsify except to promote
the glory of God.&rdquo; (Taylor&rsquo;s Diegesis, p. 345.)</p>
<p>Eusebius pronounces a panegyric upon Constantine. The following is

<p>And the church still continues to regard these two persons as holy
men of God, raised up for a wise purpose&mdash;the one an open,
wholesale murderer, and the other a cowardly, cunning and corrupt
priest. The vast injury they have done the human race can never be
computed. They poisoned the fountains of civilization, and all
Christendom has been drinking its poisoned waters ever since. If there
are anywhere in history two men who have done their fellow men more
positive harm and wrong, I do not know them. Their names should be held
up to eternal scorn.</p>
<p>Baronius, a sincere advocate of the Christian faith, calls Eusebius:
&ldquo;the great falsifier of ecclesiastical history, a wily
sychophant, a consummate hypocrite, a time serving persecutor, who had
nothing in his known life or writings <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Eusebius is the source from whom all have drawn their material. Of
him Dean Milman in a note to Gibbon&rsquo;s Rome says: &ldquo;It is
deeply to be regretted that the history of this period rests so much on
the loose, and, it must be admitted, by no means scrupulous authority
of Eusebius.&rdquo; (Page 85.)</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Not long after Christ&rsquo;s ascension into
heaven, several histories of his life and doctrines, full of pious
frauds and fabulous wonders, were composed by persons whose intentions,
perhaps, were not bad, but whose writings discovered the greatest
superstition and ignorance.&rdquo; (Mosheim&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ecclesiastical History.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian churches had scarcely been gathered and organized
when here and there men rose up who, not being contented with the
simplicity and purity of that religion which the apostles taught,
attempted innovations, and fashioned religion according to their own
liking.&rdquo; (Mosheim&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History,&rdquo;
vol. 1, c. 5.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;To avoid being imposed upon, we ought to treat tradition as
we do a notorious and known liar, to whom we give no credit, unless
what he says is confirmed to us by some person of undoubted
veracity.&rdquo; (Extract from Bower&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of the
Popes.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This opinion has always been in the world, that to settle a
certain and assured estimation upon that which is good and true, it is
necessary to remove out of the way whatever may be an hindrance to it.
Neither ought we to wonder that even those of the honest, innocent,
primitive times made use of these deceits, seeing for a good end they
made no scruple to forge whole books.&rdquo; (Daille on the Use of the
Fathers, b. 1, c. 3.)</p>

<h3 class="main">The Bible Not an Inspired Revelation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What would be the characteristics of a
revelation? 1st. A revelation would be free from inherent
contradictions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>Does the New Testament revelation stand
this test? 2d. A revelation would not contradict natural laws, for
nature is the only undisputed revelation to man. 3d. A revelation would
be so authenticated that it would be more reasonable to admit than to
deny its claims. The history of thousands of years proves that, so far,
no revelation has been made that compels the mind&rsquo;s assent, as
thousands of thinking men reject the so-called revelation of the New
Testament. The New Testament does not claim infallibility for itself;
and proving that a book is infallible does not prove that it was
inspired, else we might claim inspiration for the problems of
Euclid.&rdquo; (Anon.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Moses told the children of Israel that he received the
two tables of commandments from the hands of God, they were not obliged
to believe him, because they had no other authority for it, than his
telling them so; and I have no authority for it than some historian
telling me so. The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity
with them; they contain some good moral precepts, such as any man
qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator, could produce himself
without having recourse to supernatural intervention.&rdquo; (Thomas
Paine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Age of Reason.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revelation is a communication of something which the person,
to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done
a thing, or seen it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done
it, or seen it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.&rdquo;
(Thomas Paine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Age of Reason.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was worth God&rsquo;s while to make a revelation to man
at all, it was certainly worth his while to see to it that it was
correctly made. He would not have allowed the ideas and mistakes of
pretended prophets and designing priests to become so mingled with the
original text that it is impossible to tell where he ceased and where
the priests and prophets began. Neither will it do to say that God
adapted his revelation to the prejudices of mankind. Of course it was
necessary for an infinite being to adapt his revelation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>to
the intellectual capacity of man; but why should God confirm a
barbarian in his prejudices? Why should he fortify a heathen in his
crimes? If a revelation is of any importance whatever, it is to
eradicate prejudices from the human mind. It should be a lever with
which to raise the human race. Theologians have exhausted their
ingenuity in finding excuses for God. It seems to me that they would be
better employed in finding excuses for men. They tell us that the Jews
were so cruel and ignorant that God was compelled to justify, or nearly
to justify, many of their crimes, in order to have any influence with
them whatever. They tell us that if he had declared slavery and
polygamy to be criminal, the Jews would have refused to receive the ten
commandments. They insist that, under the circumstances, God did the
best he could; that his real intention was to lead them along slowly,
step by step, so that, in a few hundred years they would be induced to
admit that it was hardly fair to steal a babe from its mother&rsquo;s
breast. It has always seemed reasonable that an infinite God ought to
have been able to make man grand enough to know, even without a special
revelation, that it is not altogether right to steal the labor, or the
wife, or the child of another. When the whole question is thoroughly
examined, the world will find that Jehovah had the prejudices, the
hatreds, and superstitions of his day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is anything of value, it is liberty. Liberty is the
air of the soul, the sunshine of life. Without it the world is a prison
and the universe an infinite dungeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future. Before
him, like a panorama, moved the history yet to be. He knew exactly how
his words would be interpreted. He knew what crimes, what horrors, what
infamies, would be committed in his name. He knew that the fires of
persecution would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs. He knew
that brave men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with
pain; that the church would use the instruments of torture, and that
his followers would appeal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>to whip and chain. He must have
seen the horizon of the future red with the flames of the <i>auto da
fe</i>. He knew all the creeds that would spring like poisoned fungi
from every text. He saw the sects waging war against each other. He saw
thousands of men, under the orders of priests, building dungeons for
their fellow men. He saw them using instruments of pain. He heard the
groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears, the
blood&mdash;heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes. He knew that commentaries would be written on his words
with swords, to be read by the light of faggots. He knew that the
Inquisition would be born of teachings attributed to him. He saw all
the interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.
He knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these
burnings, for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the
cross. He knew that in his name his followers would trade in human
flesh, that cradles would be robbed, and woman&rsquo;s breasts unbabed
for gold, and yet he died with voiceless lips. Why did he fail to
speak? Why did he not tell his disciples, and through them the world,
that man should not persecute, for opinion&rsquo;s sake, his fellow
man? Why did he not cry, You shall not persecute in my name; you shall
not burn and torment those who differ from you in creed? Why did he not
plainly say, I am the Son of God? Why did he not explain the doctrine
of the trinity? Why did he not tell the manner of baptism that was
pleasing to him? Why did he not say something positive, definite, and
satisfactory about another world? Why did he not turn the tear-stained
hope of heaven to the glad knowledge of another life? Why did he go
dumbly to his death, leaving the world to misery and to doubt?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may ask, And what of all this? I reply, As with
everything in nature, so with the Bible. It has a different story for
each reader. Is, then, the Bible a different book to every human being
who reads it? It is. Can God, through the Bible, make precisely the
same revelation to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"
name="pb137">137</a>]</span>two persons? He cannot. Why? Because the
man who reads is not inspired. God should inspire readers as well as
writers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may reply: God knew that his book would be understood
differently by each one, and intended that it should be understood as
it is understood by each. If this is so, then my understanding of the
Bible is the real revelation to me. If this is so, I have no right to
take the understanding of another. I must take the revelation made to
me through my understanding, and by that revelation I must stand.
Suppose, then, that I read this Bible honestly, fairly, and when I get
through am compelled to say, &lsquo;The book is not true.&rsquo; If
this is the honest result, then you are compelled to say, either that
God has made no revelation to me, or that the revelation that it is not
true is the revelation made to me, and by which I am bound. If the book
and my brain are both the work of the same infinite God, whose fault is
it that the book and the brain do not agree? Either God should have
written a book to fit my brain, or should have made my brain to fit his
book. The inspiration of the Bible depends upon the credulity of him
who reads. There was a time when its geology, its astronomy, its
natural history, were thought to be inspired: that time has passed.
There was a time when its morality satisfied the men who ruled the
world of thought: that time has passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the passages that have liberated woman!</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the Old Testament, woman had to ask pardon, and
had to be purified, for the crime of having borne sons and daughters.
If in this world there is a figure of perfect purity, it is a mother
holding in her thrilled and happy arms her child. The doctrine that the
woman is the slave, or serf, of man&mdash;whether it comes from heaven
or from hell, from God or a demon, from the golden streets of the New
Jerusalem or from the very Sodom of perdition&mdash;is savagery, pure
and simple. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In no country in the world had women less liberty than in the
Holy Land, and no monarch held in less esteem the rights of wives and
mothers than Jehovah of the Jews. The position of woman was far better
in Egypt than in Palestine. Before the pyramids were built, the sacred
songs of Isis were sung by women, and women with pure hands had offered
sacrifices to the gods. Before Moses was born, women had sat upon the
Egyptian throne. Upon ancient tombs the husband and wife are
represented as seated in the same chair. In Persia women were priests,
and in some of the oldest civilizations &lsquo;they were reverenced on
earth, and worshiped afterward as goddesses in heaven.&rsquo; At the
advent of Christianity, in all Pagan countries women officiated at the
sacred altars. They guarded the eternal fire. They kept the sacred
books. From their lips came the oracles of fate. Under the domination
of the Christian church, woman became the merest slave for at least a
thousand years. It was claimed that through woman the race had fallen,
and that her loving kiss had poisoned all the springs of life.
Christian priests asserted that but for her crime the world would have
been an Eden still. The ancient fathers exhausted their eloquence in
the denunciation of woman, and repeated again and again the slander of
St. Paul. The condition of woman has improved just in proportion that
man has lost confidence in the inspiration of the Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old argument that if Christianity is a human fabrication
its authors must have been either good men or bad men, takes it for
granted that there are but two classes of persons&mdash;the good and
the bad. There is, at least, one other class&mdash;<i>the mistaken</i>,
and both of the other classes may belong to this. Thousands of most
excellent people have been deceived, and the history of the world is
filled with instances where men have honestly supposed that they had
received communications from angels and gods.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s
Reply to Black.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But an infinite being must know not only the real meaning of
the words, but the exact meaning they will convey to every reader and
hearer. He must know every meaning that they are capable of conveying
to every mind. He must also know what explanations must be made to
prevent misconception. If an infinite being cannot, in making a
revelation to man, use such words that every person to whom a
revelation is essential, will understand distinctly what that
revelation is, then a revelation from God, through the instrumentality
of language is impossible, or it is not essential that all should
understand it correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, the real question is, not whether the Bible is
inspired, but whether it is true. If it is true, it does not need to be
inspired. If it is true, it makes no difference whether it was written
by a man or a god. The multiplication table is just as useful, just as
true as though God had arranged the figures himself. If the Bible is
really true, the claim of inspiration need not be urged; and if it is
not true, its inspiration can hardly be established. As a matter of
fact, the truth does not need to be inspired. Nothing needs inspiration
except a falsehood or a mistake.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Mistakes of Moses,&rdquo; p. 59.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be argued that millions have not the capacity to
understand a revelation, although expressed in plainest words. To this
it seems a sufficient reply, to ask, why a being of infinite power
should create men so devoid of intelligence, that he cannot by any
means make known to them his will?&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Mistakes of Moses,&rdquo; p. 90.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millions have declared this book to be infinitely holy, to
prove that they were right have imprisoned, robbed and burned their
fellow men. The inspiration of this book has been established by
famine, sword, and fire, by dungeon, chain, and whip, by dagger and by
rack, by force and fear and fraud, and generations have been frightened
by threats of hell, and bribed with promises of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we been born in Turkey, most of us would have been
Mohammedans and believed in the inspiration of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>Koran. We should have believed that Mohammed
actually visited heaven and became acquainted with an angel by the name
of Gabriel who was so broad between the eyes that it required three
hundred days for a very smart mule to travel the distance. If some man
had denied this story we should have denounced him as a dangerous
person, one who was endeavoring to undermine the foundations of
society, and to destroy all distinctions between virtue and vice. We
should have said to him &lsquo;What do you propose to give us in place
of this angel? We cannot afford to give up an angel of that size for
nothing.&rsquo; We would have insisted that the wisest and best men
believed the Koran.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mistakes of
Moses,&rdquo; p. 36.)</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=

<p>2. The Bible sanctions cruelties. The wars of extermination waged by
the Jews upon surrounding nations afford ample proof.</p>
<p>3. The Bible indorses immorality. It indorses war, slavery,
polygamy, intemperance, and superstition.</p>
<p>4. The writers of the gospels do not claim to be inspired.</p>
<p>5. We do not know when, where, or by whom, either the gospels or the
books supposed to be written by Moses, were composed.</p>
<p>6. Paul says: &ldquo;All scripture is given by inspiration of God;
but there is (1.) no definite meaning attached to the word inspiration.
(2.) He does not refer to the gospels for they had no existence when he
wrote.</p>

sects quarreling about the meaning of the &ldquo;inspired

<h3 class="main">God&rsquo;s Ways are Not Our Ways.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Now this God either did or he did not believe
in and command murder and rapine in the days when he used to sit around
evenings and chat with Abraham and Moses and the rest of them. His
especial plans and desires were &lsquo;revealed&rsquo; or they were
not. The ideas of justice and right were higher in those days than they
are now, or else we are wiser and better than God, or else the Bible is
not his revealed will. You can take your choice. My choice is to keep
my respect for divine justice and honor, and let the Bible bear the
burden of its own mistakes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If religion is a revelation, then it is not a growth, and it
would have been most perfect in design and plan when it was nearest its
birth. Now accepting the Bible theory of Jehovah, we find that when the
communications of God were immediate and personal there could have been
no mistake as to his will. To deal with it as a growth or evolution
toward better things is to abandon the whole tenet of a revealed law of
God. But to deal with it as a revelation is to make God a being too
repulsive and brutal to contemplate for one moment with respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He either did or did not tell those men those things. Which
will you accept?&rdquo; (Helen Gardener&rsquo;s &ldquo;Men, Women, and
Gods.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revelation when applied to religion, means something
communicated <i>immediately</i> from God to man. No one will deny or
dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication, if he
pleases. But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been
revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any other person, it
is revelation to that person only. When he tells it to a second person,
a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a
revelation to all those persons. It is a revelation to the first person
only, and <i>hearsay</i> to every other, and, consequently, they are
not obliged to believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a contradiction in terms and ideas, to call anything a
revelation that comes to us at second-hand, either verbally or in
writing. Revelation is necessarily limited to the first
communication&mdash;after this, it is only an account of something
which that person says was a revelation made to him; and though he may
find himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent upon me to
believe it in the same manner; for it was not a revelation made to
<i>me</i>, and I have only his word for it that it was made to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am told that the Koran was written in heaven, and
brought to Mahomet by an angel, the account comes too near the same
kind of hearsay evidence and second-hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>authority as the
former.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3210src" href="#xd21e3210" name=
"xd21e3210src">1</a> I did not see the angel myself, and, therefore, I
have a right not to believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When also I am told that a woman called the Virgin Mary,
said, or gave out, that she was with child without any cohabitation
with a man, and that her betrothed husband, Joseph, said that an angel
told him so, I have a right to believe them or not; such a circumstance
required a much stronger evidence than their bare word for it; but we
have not even this&mdash;for neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such
matter themselves; it is only reported by others that <i>they said
so</i>&mdash;it is hearsay upon hearsay, and I do not choose to rest my
belief upon such evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, however, not difficult to account for the credit that
was given to the story of Jesus Christ being the Son of God. He was
born when the heathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in
the world, and that mythology had prepared the people for the belief of
such a story. Almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the
heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods. It
was not a new thing at that time, to believe a man to have been
celestially begotten; the intercourse of gods with women was then a
matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter, according to their accounts,
had cohabited with hundreds; the story therefore had nothing in it
either new, wonderful, or obscene; it was conformable to the opinions
that then prevailed among the people called Gentiles, or Mythologists,
and it was those people only that believed it. The Jews who had kept
strictly to the belief of one God, and no more, and who had always
rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the
Christian church, sprung out of the tail of heathen mythology. A direct
incorporation took place in the first instance, by making the reputed
founder to be celestially begotten. The trinity of gods that then
followed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>was no other than a reduction of the former
plurality, which was about twenty or thirty thousand; the statue of
Mary succeeded the statue of Diana of Ephesus, the deification of
heroes changed into the canonization of saints; the mythologists had
gods for everything; the Christian mythologists had saints for
everything; the church became as crowded with the one, as the pantheon
had been with the other; and Rome was the place of both. The Christian
theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient mythologists,
accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue; and it yet remains
to reason and philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that is here said can apply even with the most
distant disrespect, to the <i>real</i> character of Jesus Christ. He
was a virtuous and an amiable man. The morality that he preached and
practiced was of the most <span class="corr" id="xd21e3229" title=
"Source: benovolent">benevolent</span> kind; and though similar systems
of morality had been preached by Confucius, and by some of the Greek
philosophers, many years before; by the Quakers since; and by many good
men in all ages, it has not been exceeded by any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ wrote no account of himself, of his birth,
parentage, or anything else; not a line of what is called the New
Testament is of his own writing. The history of him is altogether the
work of other people; and as to the account given of his resurrection
and ascension, it was the necessary counterpart to the story of his
birth. His historians, having brought him into the world in a
supernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the same
manner, or the first part of the story must have fallen to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first part, that of the miraculous conception, was not a
thing that admitted of publicity; and therefore the tellers of this
part of the story had this advantage, that though they might not be
credited, they could not be detected.&rdquo; (Thomas Paine&rsquo;s

<h2 class="main">THE DEVIL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have nothing new to offer on this old subject, and I
therefore warn the reader not to expect any wonderful revelations. The
Devil is not an object of recent discovery. He is as old as the hills.
Everybody seems to know him, and he seems to know everybody. It would
therefore be in vain for me to attempt to give any information
respecting this old friend. However, as there are some thoughts which
persist in bolting into my mind regarding old Nick, I have concluded to
jot them down for those who have a taste for devilish reading.</p>
<p>It was always a question that greatly perplexed me, when a boy, why
God should create the Devil. I never could see it in any other light
than that of an egregious blunder. Why should an infinitely good being
create an infinitely bad being? Why did not the Creator make all of his
creatures perfect? Why did he not save them from being lost? Why did he
form man to place him in the garden to be tempted and ruined when it
was in the Creator&rsquo;s power to prevent his fall? Why did he not
create him so good and so strong that it would be impossible for him to
do wrong? Why was the Serpent (the Devil) made so much stronger and
wiser than man? If Adam had only been made a great deal stronger, and
the Serpent less seductive, the human race might have had a glorious
and brilliant career. But as it was a powerful serpent-devil on the one
hand, and on the other, a weak-headed know-nothing man, is it not clear
that better results could not have been expected? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>Why did not the author of the red man (Adam) tell him that he was
going to have a severe temptation?&mdash;that he was soon to meet his
great adversary? It is highly probable that Adam could have made a
better showing if he had only been advised of the situation in time.
But as it was he did not have a fair chance. It would have been no more
than justice to have told Adam and Eve all about the Serpent-devil
which was hid away somewhere in the garden like a snake in the grass.
It would have been only fair to have posted on all the fences and walls
about the garden, this sign, &ldquo;Adam and Eve, Beware of
Snakes!&rdquo; This would have given them a chance for their lives.
Poor Adam and Eve! They were not a bad lot, but were transplanted too
early, and were nipped in the bud by the great original Serpent, who
was acting according to his nature and circumstances, and therefore we
cannot find it in our hearts to be too severe on his Satanic Majesty.
If Satan was great, it was not won by his own powers, he had greatness
thrust upon him. Let us be just; let us give the Devil his due. I have
no doubt but he has grievances, if there were any court where he could
offer his complaints.</p>
<p>The Creator made both man and Serpent-devil, knowing just what would
and must come to pass, and he did it all for his own glory. He also
made hell for his own glory. Surely the Lord&rsquo;s ways are not our
ways. For no Modoc Indian would entertain such a design toward his
children, no matter how bad they might be, or how vicious his own
nature.</p>
<p>We cannot think of a creator without seeing that he as the author of
all things, is responsible for <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>, for
<i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i>, for <i>ignorance</i> and
<i>knowledge</i>, for <i>truth</i> and <i>error</i>. Man is therefore,
no more responsible for his nature than a steam engine is responsible
for its defects. The defects must be attributed to the maker in both
cases.</p>
<p>Adam knew good and evil without eating of the tree of knowledge. He
had a brain, and his thoughts were imperfect; sometimes they were
relatively correct, and then again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202"
href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>they were wholly wrong or in
error. This was knowing good and evil, therefore he knew good and evil
without eating of the prohibited fruit, just as surely as he had a
brain. The tree of knowledge is a very childish story. Knowledge does
not grow on trees, nor does much of it exist in heads which entertain
such fables as a divine revelation.</p>
<p>Man was created with a brain to do his thinking and knowing, and by
its very nature of knowing he must know good and evil, and yet he is
cursed for knowing good and evil. As well might the Creator give the
bird wings, toss it in the air and then damn it for flying. But even
supposing the story to be true, namely, that the fruit of the tree made
one to know good and evil, why should such desirable fruit be
forbidden? What would the world be without the knowledge of good and
evil? Man cannot know <i>good</i> without also knowing <i>evil</i>.
They are inseparable. God himself knows good and evil, and if it is
good for him to have such knowledge, then it surely must be good for
you and me. The love of knowledge is the fountain of life. Man must
have knowledge or his life is a mere cipher. All hail then to Mother
Eve, who first tasted of the tree of knowledge, who first quenched her
thirst at this fountain from which the whole race of thirsty souls have
delighted to drink. Mythology abounds in stories about the gods; about
their imperfections and weaknesses, but this account of the
Serpent-devil and the tree of knowledge is the silliest fable of all,
and has entailed indescribable misery upon the human race. The
prohibition of knowledge has left an inherited twist in human nature.
Even now in the afternoon of the nineteenth century mankind does not
know much&mdash;and it is largely due to this first commandment not to
partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Has not the church
always prohibited knowledge? Has she not stood in the way of every
great reform? Knowledge is not important. Only believe. Believe in the
Bible, but believe it only as the priest explains it.</p>
<p>It seems that the Serpent-devil knew more about the nature of man,
and what would result from his eating the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>fruit of the tree of
knowledge than God did. Jehovah told Adam in plain terms, that if he
ate of the fruit of that tree he would die that very day. But the
Serpent-devil told Eve (in French I suppose) that she and her
&ldquo;hubby&rdquo; would do no such a thing, but on the contrary it
would be a great blessing to them, and that they would become as gods
(there were lots of gods in those days and many of them &ldquo;no great
shakes&rdquo;), knowing good and evil. It turned out just as the
Serpent-devil had told Mother Eve; they did not die. And when God saw
what Adam and Eve had done he called a conclave of gods, and after due
deliberation voted to drive them out of the garden penniless, to live
upon the cold charities of an unfriendly world. And this is the same
God who commands us to <i>forgive</i> and to <i>love</i> our enemies.
That would not be god-like, and therefore I hold the commandment
invalid.</p>
<p>In this august assemblage of the celestial hosts, one of their
number assigns the reasons for expelling Adam and Eve from the garden
in these words: &ldquo;Behold the man (and woman) has become as one of
us to know good and evil.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203:22">Gen. 3&nbsp;:
22</a>.) Here we see it is a surprise to the gods that man had become
as one of them, knowing good and evil. Yet these gods are supposed to
<i>know all things</i> from all eternity to all eternity. Do the gods
forget things as we poor mortals do?</p>
<p>The Serpent had told Eve just what would happen, and God told Adam
just that which did not happen. The Serpent said: &ldquo;For God doth
know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,
and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. Ye shall not surely
die.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203:4-5">Gen. 3&nbsp;:
5, 4</a>.) The Serpent gave it straight, and God made a mistake to say
the least. In all this story about the fall of man, the Devil appears
to be a better friend of man than his Creator.</p>
<p>The Serpent was in reality not the enemy, but the friend of man. He
spoke words of truth and encouragement to Adam at a time when he needed
good counsel. It is not to be forgotten that he spoke the truth. The
poisonous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>tongue of malice has called him the father of
lies, but this saying is a lie itself&mdash;and a bald-headed lie of
sufficient antiquity to be itself most appropriately called the father
of lies. The Devil, Lucifer, is the light-bearer, the truth revealer;
but the world at large has an impression that there is a screw loose
somewhere, and have unwittingly ascribed the evil to the Devil, when a
very slight study of his character and deeds will show that &ldquo;the
Devil is not half as black as he is painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next account we have of him is in the book of Job (not a Hebrew
writing), where he appears under the title of Satan. It is to be borne
in mind that he has many names. In the book of Genesis we left him a
serpent with a curse pronounced upon him: &ldquo;Because thou hast done
this thou art cursed above all cattle [what kind of cattle is a snake?]
and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly thou shalt go, and
dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203:14">Gen. 3&nbsp;:
14</a>.) Prior to the great fall of Adam and Eve, when they fell upward
and became as the gods, it seems the Serpent had always hopped along
erect, on the tip end of his tail, but because he had divulged some
court secrets, he was condemned to crawl upon his belly the rest of his
natural life (which is, I should remark, uncommonly long); but in the
book of Job he says of himself that he has been &ldquo;walking up and
down in the earth.&rdquo; Who told him to get up? Was he not cursed to
go on his belly for all time to come? How could he walk? A snake has no
legs. When, where, how, and by whom was this transformation of a
hideous serpent into a prince-like man, accomplished? I don&rsquo;t
know. Perhaps it is a sort of Santa Claus story, coming down to us from
the childhood of the race. All peoples have similar traditions which
spring from early myths. Our Devil story will have to get in line and
march in the procession of fables. There are many people, and people of
the very best kind, who do not have any Devil. He has left them and
gone on a permanent vacation. On the other hand, there are folks who
could not feel happy if they thought there were no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>Devil. To all such, who may read this, I would
ask a few questions which if they will intelligently answer, I shall be
greatly obliged.</p>
<p>Did the Serpent talk? How could he speak without having the vocal
organs necessary to human speech? Who taught him the use of language?
What language did he speak? Was it French? I merely suggest the French,
as Adam and Eve took French leave of the garden. Did the Serpent reason
like a man? How could he with such a small head and not even a spoonful
of brains, know so much more than Adam and Eve? Yea, he even knew more
than God himself&mdash;for God did not know, or else he fibbed, that
man would not die if he ate the forbidden fruit. He did not seem to
know that man would become as the gods by partaking of this tree, but
the Serpent knew all this and possibly much more; but how could so much
superior knowledge be crowded into so small a head? Some of our
congressmen with domes of unusual dimensions do not know as much as
this inexperienced Serpent did. How are we to account for this? Let
some devilishly wise man explain to a benighted world why Satan has
been so wickedly traduced.</p>
<p>In the book of Job we have a second account of the Devil: &ldquo;Now
there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before
the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan,
Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord and said, From going
to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the
Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there
is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that
feareth God and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the Lord and said,
Doth Job fear God for naught? Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and
about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast
blest the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land.
But put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath, and he will
curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>Behold all that he hath is in thy power; only
upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went from the presence of
the Lord.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%201:6-12">Job 1&nbsp;:
6&ndash;12</a>.) Then follows an account of the destruction of the
cattle and children of Job, and yet he would not curse God. Satan then
suggested that to afflict him in person would bring out his weakness
and deeply hidden wickedness. Job was tormented with boils, and three
gratuitous advisors, and did not curse God, but came very nearly giving
his counselors a cuss word or two. They exasperated him beyond
measure.</p>
<p>Now while it must be admitted that the Devil does not show up to as
great advantage in this fable as he does in that relating to the tree
of knowledge, yet we should not jump to our conclusions. Let us review
this Job story.</p>
<p>We are surprised at the dignified manners of Satan. He walks in with
lordly airs among the sons of God. No one present said to him,
&ldquo;Get out of here.&rdquo; He struts around in the gay company as
one of them. We hardly know how to understand such familiarity possible
between the sons of God and Satan. If, however, the sons of God in
those days were no better than the sons of God are in these, it is not
in the least surprising that Satan should conduct himself as well as
the best of them. But why did God permit him to do these cruel things
to Job? In a certain book by God, we are told to &ldquo;resist the
Devil and he will flee from thee.&rdquo; This would have been splendid
medicine for the doctors who prescribed it. Satan did not come there so
far as we see to work any temptation. It was God who set up the
temptation before Satan. He began by asking Satan what he thought of
Job. What mattered it what his opinion of Job might be? Why should his
opinion be asked? Was it not showing respect to him? God should have
said, &ldquo;Get behind me Satan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satan had seen many men who could not stand in the hour of trial,
and not knowing Job he took him for a man of that kind; God, however,
knew Job to be a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; man and ought to have protected
him from all evil. Yet he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>did nothing of the kind, but on
the contrary, clothed Satan with power of destroying his cattle and
children, and afflicting him with tormenting boils. We see then that it
is not Satan who is responsible for the sufferings of the patient man,
but God himself, who first shows respect to Satan&rsquo;s presence and
his opinions, then gives him power by which he does a monstrous wrong
to a good man and his family. But if Satan&rsquo;s part is bad
God&rsquo;s is worse. He is the author of all of Job&rsquo;s miseries.
If God had been just, he would not have led off to his Satanic Majesty
with such a temptation as to ask him his opinion of Job. It was
immaterial what his opinion was; but it was all important that if there
were a God in Israel that he should protect and honor the
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; man, Job.</p>
<p>But aside from the barbarities of this myth, look at its childish
absurdities. How could the omniscient, whose eyes are in every place,
beholding the evil and the good, need to ask Satan where he came from!
Was not God, the omnipresent, everywhere on earth? If Satan had been
going up and down the country would he not of necessity have met God
again and again? Obviously these great opponents must have often met.
Again, it was useless for God to ask Satan what his opinion of Job was,
or would be after he tested him, as he knows all things past, present,
and to come, in heaven, earth and hell (I mean hades). It is evident
that Satan&rsquo;s opinion is not needed or cared for, because after
all the trials Job suffered were ended, there is not one word given as
to what Satan&rsquo;s opinion of Job was, and yet in the beginning of
the story this seems to be its sole object. After Job suffers a long
time from bodily sores and &ldquo;miserable comforters&rdquo; Satan
vanishes from the scene in a very obscure way, and God blesses Job with
twice as much as he had before. He had more sheep, more camels, more
oxen, and more asses. He became father of seven sons and three
daughters, the same number of sons and daughters that were slain by
Satan, instigated by God. Why were these ten innocent persons murdered?
Had they no rights that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>a just God was bound to respect?
Shall not the judge of all the earth do right? Certainly he ought to.
But in this case the judge pleads guilty of this crime. In reply to
Satan God says: &ldquo;Although thou movedst me against him to destroy
him <i>without cause</i>.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%202:3">Job 2&nbsp;:
3</a>.) Here is an unqualified confession of wronging Job and his
children without a show of justice; and even the cattle, I imagine,
would protest against the outrageous slaughter perpetrated on them. If
these asses were like Balaam&rsquo;s, I am sure they would enter suit
for damages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his
beginning, for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels,
and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. He had also
seven sons and three daughters.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%2042:12-13">Job
42&nbsp;: 12, 13</a>.) It is clear that the Lord had nothing to do
whatever with these blessings. Job had had sheep, camels, oxen, asses,
and children before, without any assistance from the Lord; and if he
secured a similar stock of cattle and a family of children it was by
his own management and husbandry.</p>
<p>But supposing them a gift from God as damages sustained by Job at
the hand of Satan through the instigation of God, yet they could not
assuage his grief for the loved ones ruthlessly torn from his embrace.
It is easy to see that this story is nothing more than an oriental
tale&mdash;a myth. It is wanting not only in fact, but it teaches very
bad morals. There is nothing ennobling in it. 1. God had no moral right
to permit Satan to come unrebuked into the company of the sons of God.
An earthly father teaches his children to avoid &ldquo;evil
communications,&rdquo; but on this occasion the heavenly father did not
scorn the company of Satan, but treated him respectfully. 2. Again, the
infinite being would not need to ask the Devil what his opinion of Job
was, for he would know beforehand. 3. The infinitely good being would
not want the Devil&rsquo;s opinion&mdash;nor would he value it a straw,
if it were given before it was asked. 4. The infinitely just ruler of
the universe would not give the great adversary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>of
man and God such diabolical power over that &ldquo;perfect and upright
man&rdquo; Job. Nor would he have permitted the three &ldquo;miserable
comforters,&rdquo; reeling mentally under the blind staggers of a blind
theology, to have added more torment to that imposed by his Satanic
Majesty. Nor would he have permitted him to murder the seven sons and
three daughters, as a mere matter of experiment in testing Job&rsquo;s
staying powers. All this is so horrible that the afterthought of more
camels and asses, as a compensation is an insufficient patch to cover
the unqualified wrongs done to the man of Uz. Even Job does not shine
as conspicuously in all this as he should. Job ought to have protested
with all his might and main against both God and Devil, that his
individual rights were invaded. He should have taken a change of venue,
to have a hearing before some other god, where there was a slight hope
of securing more justice. But he didn&rsquo;t and the consequence is we
are all advised, when suffering the outrageous wrongs of despotism, to
&ldquo;be patient like Job.&rdquo; It has been a great evil to the
human family that Job was no &ldquo;kicker;&rdquo; it has opened wide
the flood gates of tyranny, and transfused the cowardly blood of sheep
into the veins of men. Oh, that Job had kicked and taken an appeal,
what an inspiration it would be to the fold of God now, to resist the
shears of the fleecers! to rebel against the rule of robbers!</p>
<p>Some questions to be answered by the man who pounds the Bible and
claims to understand the Greek scriptures:</p>
<p>1. Who were the sons of God?</p>
<p>2. How many were there present, and were there still more of them
elsewhere?</p>
<p>3. Where did they come from?</p>
<p>4. Were they any relation to the people of Nod?</p>
<p>5. Who were their mothers?</p>
<p>6. What were their occupations?</p>
<p>7. Where are they now?</p>
<p>8. Where did the Devil come from?</p>
<p>9. Did God create him or did he make himself? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>10. If God made him then is he not responsible for all that old Nick
does?</p>
<p>11. If he is as terribly demoniacal as orthodox theology describes
him, &ldquo;why in &rsquo;l don&rsquo;t God kill the Devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>12. If he cannot kill him does it not prove that the Devil is his
match; and if he can, but will not, does it not prove that he sustains
him and approves of his work?</p>
<p>13. In the light of modern theology is not the Devil almost always
successful? Does he not have a larger kingdom, a larger following than
God?</p>
<p>14. Why did the Creator inflict such a hellish punishment upon Adam
and Eve, and let the Serpent off so lightly?</p>
<p>15. Has the punishment inflicted upon the Devil lessened his
power?</p>
<p>16. Have the curses which God has pronounced on the world made it
better?</p>
<p>17. Is there any place in the record, accounts of the Devil&rsquo;s
stealing, robbing, and murdering?</p>
<p>18. Are there not numerous stories in the Bible recounting the
robberies and murders perpetrated in the name and by the sanction of
God? Some times the people of God destroyed five thousand, ten
thousand, twenty thousand, fifty thousand, seventy thousand, and in one
instance six hundred and seventy thousand, as in the case of Pharaoh
and his hosts in the Red sea. Did Satan ever try to do anything as
hellish as this?</p>
<p>19. Is the Devil the father of lies? When did he tell a deliberate
falsehood? To Eve? Oh no, it was the other party who did that
business.</p>
<p>20. Did he lie when he took Jesus up into an exceeding high
mountain, etc., and saith unto him, &ldquo;All these will I give
thee,&rdquo; etc.? (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%204:8">Mat. 4&nbsp;:
8</a>.) It is claimed that old Beelzebub lied on this occasion. It
would hit the bull&rsquo;s eye in the center if we were to say that the
writer of this story about Jesus being carried off bodily into an
exceeding high mountain, was the boy responsible for this lie. But
without resting the case there let us see how it opens out. It is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>urged that &ldquo;the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s
and the fullness thereof;&rdquo; but it may be urged that the Devil is
called &ldquo;the prince of this world,&rdquo; implying that he has
just claims both by conquest and possession; and therefore he could
have given at least a quitclaim deed.</p>
<p>The Devil is an expensive luxury of the church. It costs about
$1,000,000,000 annually for preaching against the Devil. Even if there
is less said derogatory to his Satanic Majesty now-adays, yet it costs
just as much, and more too, for drawing it mild, than it did formerly,
for describing the split hoof, horns, and spear-headed tail, hell, etc.
Notwithstanding the fact that the people want less Devil and more bread
and beef, yet they must have some Devil. Hence the church clings to its
Devil-idol with which to scare the people. To give up the Devil is to
break up house-keeping all around. If there be no Devil then there is
no hell; and if no hell, there is no salvation; and if no salvation
there is no need of preaching; and &ldquo;no preach no pay.&rdquo; How
could a fat minister with a fat salary, look such a ghost as that in
the face? Yes, it would be impossible for the church to survive without
the Devil. The clergy have to fall back upon him in times of revival to
stir up the fears of uninformed people.</p>
<p>The Devil has had many hard names heaped upon him, for example: The
Tempter; the Adversary or Satan; Beelzebub; the Prince of Devils; the
Strong One; the Enemy, or the Hostile One; the Serpent; Lying Spirit;
Lucifer; Son of the Morning; Prince of Darkness; Prince of the Power of
the Air; the Accuser; Angel of the Bottomless Pit; Angel of Light;
Mammon; Belial; Legion; the Foul Spirit; the Unclean Spirit; the God of
this World; the Great Red Dragon; Abaddon; Apollyon, the Destroyer,
etc. Besides these <i>sacred</i> titles, he is equally well known by
certain house-hold names, as, Old Nick; Old Splitfoot; the Old Scratch;
Old Harry; Old Horny; the Old Boy; the Deuce; the Dickens; auld Clouty;
Nickie; Ben; his Satanic Majesty, etc. It must be confessed that these
names do not carry much sanctity with them, nor do they leave us in
love with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>the character they represent. But before we
proceed further, it is only simple justice (that is giving the Devil
his due), to call attention to the various names by which God has been
known.</p>
<p>The early Hebrew literature speaks of <i>gods</i>, not God. We find
the following names ascribed to them: El; Elohim; El Shaddai; Shaddai;
Elvoh; Yahve, or Jah. The following is a personal photograph as nearly
as we can draw it, of the Jewish Jehovah as described in the Bible:
&ldquo;There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>This God has violated all the moral laws he ever gave to man. He
approved of lying, robbing, adultery, murder, war, and all the great
crimes known to man.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Theodore Parker should say to the Calvinist
who was trying to convert him, &ldquo;The difference between us is
simple,&mdash;your <i>God</i> is my <i>Devil</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader has his choice&mdash;or he may say &ldquo;good Lord good
Devil,&rdquo; and float with the current. There is, however, no
disguising the fact that between God and the Devil, as described in the
Bible, the Devil sustains the better moral character of the two. He is
not spotless and clean, it is true, but he has infinitely less
bloodshed to answer for than Jehovah. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>Where the Devil did he come from? I am reminded of this form of
expression by a little incident related of a Scotch preacher, who took
for his text, on one occasion, the following passage: &ldquo;The Devil,
as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pt%205:8">1 Peter
5&nbsp;: 8</a>.) It must be borne in mind, in order to better
understand the full force and beauty of the preacher&rsquo;s division
of the text into three heads, that it was common in earlier times to
repeat the pronoun in a sentence, for example, John Smith, his book,
Mary she has come home, etc. In charming accord with this old style,
the minister divided his text into three parts. He said, &ldquo;My
brethren, we will first inquire where the Devil he was walking to? and
secondly, who the Devil he wanted to devour? and thirdly, what the
Devil he was roaring about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gratuitously thrown in this gem, we proceed to answer the
question, &ldquo;Where the Devil, did he come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is evident that the earlier Hebrew literature is almost wholly
free from any traces of a personal Devil, and that later writings of
the same people show strong outline of such a personality of evil.</p>
<p>While it is true that Satan is a Hebrew word, it is equally true
that the word does not denote a being at all, but means anything
adverse or opposing. We may cite in illustration a few passages. Second
Samuel 19&nbsp;: 22: &ldquo;David said, What have we to do with you, ye
sons of Jeremiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto
me?&rdquo; First Kings 11&nbsp;: 14: &ldquo;And Jehovah stirred up an
adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Adomite.&rdquo; First Kings 11&nbsp;:
23: &ldquo;And God stirred up <i>another</i> adversary, Rezon, the son
of Eliadah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these instances, the word rendered adversary or adversaries, is
Satan, and means nothing more than an opponent.</p>
<p>When the Jews were carried captives to Babylon, they came into
immediate contact with a people, the Persians, who believed in a good
being and a bad one. Ormazd was their good God, and Ahriman their
Devil. The latter was as clearly defined in the duality of Zoroastrian
theology, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>the former. During their seventy years&rsquo;
captivity it could not be otherwise, than that the enslaved people
should imbibe some of the customs and beliefs of their masters. If they
went so far as to change the characters of their language from the
original Hebrew letters to those of the Chaldas, it is easy to see that
they would of course, adopt this notion of an evil principle and
personality, so prevalent at that time in Chaldea. After the Babylonian
exile the doctrine of a Devil became a part of the Jewish belief, and
the evil spirit was termed Satan, as he was the foe or adversary of
God. In First Chronicles 21&nbsp;: 1, there is a circumstance related
in which Satan or the Devil is the principal agent. The words are:
&ldquo;And Satan stood up against <span class="corr" id="xd21e7750"
title="Source: Isreal">Israel</span> and provoked David to number
Israel.&rdquo; Now the book of Chronicles being written after the
captivity, it was quite natural that the writer should consider and
designate the enemy of God, the Devil or Satan. But the same event is
mentioned in another of the Jewish books, written before the captivity,
and the temptation of David is referred to entirely another being. Here
the words are:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And again the anger of the Lord was kindled
against Israel, and moved David against them, to say, &lsquo;Go number
Israel and Judah,&rsquo; Thus in the earlier books, the affair is
attributed to the Lord, but in the books written after the Jewish
connection with the Chaldeans and Persians, Satan is blamed for the
same act. This, beyond doubt proves the source of the Christian
superstition respecting the Devil.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Devil,&rdquo; by
John Watts.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this dualistic system the Jews came in contact during
their captivity at Babylon, and are supposed to have retained permanent
traces of it in their subsequent theology. The conception of the Devil
and of a lower kingdom of demons or devils is the evident illustration
of this. (Ency. Brit. V. Devil.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason why there was no Devil in the early books was
because none was needed then. The gods considered themselves as being
quite equal to any emergency that might arise in the way of
wickedness.&rdquo;&mdash;M. D. Conway.</p>
</div>
<p>In other words, the Devil is a myth coming out of the terrible
darkness of remote ages. Every fear that the primitive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>man
and men of barbarous races have had, painted devils before their minds
of every description. The master mind has said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the eye of child-hood</p>
<p class="line">That fears a painted Devil.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The thought that millions of people commonly well
informed on general matters, still believe in this barbarous myth, must
shock and oppress like an incubus every sensitive and well-informed
mind. Such people can smile pleasantly over the homely myth of Santa
Claus, but the Devil is altogether a different personage. An old lady
was once told that the Devil was dead. She sat silent for a moment, and
then replied, &ldquo;Well, you may think so, but we hope for better
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the horrid doctrine of witchcraft under the light of advancing
knowledge has had to retire into the background of oblivion; as the
Puritan doctrine of infant damnation has been relegated to the limbo of
forgetfulness; as hell&rsquo;s fire has burned to ashes and the ashes
become cold, so too, is the doctrine of a personal Devil retreating
from the minds of all sensible people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">Until the Greek philosophy taught the world how to use
and abuse abstract notions, immaterialism was not an attainable phase
of thought. (Prof. Bain, &ldquo;Mind and Body,&rdquo; p. 143.)</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Thought necessarily supposes conditions. To think is
to condition, and conditional limitation is the fundamental law of the
possibility of thought. For, as the greyhound cannot outstrip his
shadow, nor (by a more appropriate simile) the eagle out-soar the
atmosphere in which he floats, and by which alone he may be supported;
so the mind cannot transcend the sphere of limitation, within and

<p>In this paper an attempt is made to answer two very important
questions, namely: What is, and where is the soul? in such fashion that
everybody will be satisfied that he has a soul, and the exact spot it
occupies in his mundane tabernacle. Here are a number of opinions on
this subject, by the most learned men the world has ever produced. In a
multitude of counsel there is wisdom. The first witness I shall put
upon the stand is:</p>
<p>Pythagoras: (6th c. B. C.) The soul is number and a harmony. Taught
the doctrine of metempsychosis. His disciples held the soul to be an
aggregate of particles of great subtilty pervading the air in constant
agitation.</p>
<p>Heraclitus: (6th c. B. C.) The soul is a spark of the stellar
essence: &ldquo;Scintilla stellaris essentia.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pherecides: (6th c. B. C.) Souls existed from all eternity.</p>
<p>Anaximenes: (Ionic philosopher, 5th c. B. C.) God is air, air is a
life-giving principle to man. The soul is air.</p>
<p>Diogenes of Appollonia: (Greek natural philosopher, 5th c. B. C.)
The soul of the world and the soul of man is air.</p>
<p>Anaxagoras: (5th c. B. C.) The soul is an immortal, aerial
spirit.</p>
<p>Socrates: (4th c. B. C.) The soul is corporeal and eternal.</p>
<p>Epicurus: (4th c. B. C.) The soul is a bodily substance, composed of
subtile particles, disseminated through the whole frame, and having a
great resemblance to spirit or breath.</p>
<p>Empedocles: (Sicilian philosopher and poet, 5th c. B. C.) Declared
himself to have been &ldquo;a boy, a girl, a bush, a bird, a
fish;&rdquo; that the soul inhabits every form of animal and plant.</p>
<p>Aristotle: (4th c. B. C.) Plants have souls without consciousness.
Animals have souls, but inseparable from body. The human body is
inseparable from mind, but the human mind is divided into active and
passive intellect. The active intellect is pure form, detached from
matter, and immortal.</p>
<p>Josephus: (1st c.) There were three sects among the Jews&mdash;the
Pharisees, <span class="corr" id="xd21e7813" title=
"Source: Sadduces">Sadducees</span>, and the Essenes. The Pharisees
believed in metempsychosis; the <span class="corr" id="xd21e7816"
title="Source: Sadduces">Sadducees</span> believed that the soul
perished with the body; the Essenes held that the soul was immortal.
The soul descended in an aerial form into the body, from the highest
region of the air, whither they were carried back again by a violent
attraction, and after death those which had belonged to the good
dwelled beyond the ocean in a country where there was neither heat nor
cold, nor wind nor rain.</p>
<p>Pliny: (2d c.) The body and the soul have, from the moment of death,
as little sensation as before birth.</p>
<p>Justin Martyr: (2d c.) It is heresy to say that the soul is taken up
into heaven, men rise with the same bodies. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tatian: (2d c.) There are two spirits conjoined in the human body. A
material and an immaterial spirit.</p>
<p>Athenagoras: (2d c.) The soul is spiritual, but with a spirituality
subject to material tendencies.</p>
<p>Origen: (3d c.) The soul is neither spirit nor matter.</p>
<p>Augustine: (4th c.) The soul has neither length, breadth, nor
thickness. It acts on the body through the corporeal substances of
light and air, which substances are mingled through the denser parts of
the body. The commands of the soul are first communicated to this
subtile matter, and by it immediately conveyed to the heavier
elements.</p>
<p>Tertullian: (Latin father, about 160.) The soul has the human form,
the same as its body, only it is delicate, clear, and ethereal. Unless
it were corporeal, how could it be effected by the body, be able to
suffer, or be nourished within the body?</p>
<p>St. Ambrose: (4th c.) We know nothing but what is material,
excepting only the ever venerable Trinity.</p>
<p>St. Hilary: (5th c.) There is nothing created which is not
corporeal, neither in heaven nor in earth, neither visible nor
invisible; all is formed of elements; and souls, whether they inhabit a
body, or are without a body, have always a corporeal substance.</p>
<p>Gregory Nazianzen: (4th c.) Soul, or spirit, is composed of two
properties&mdash;motion and diffusion.</p>
<p>Bishop Nemesius: (5th c.) The soul is an immaterial substance. It is
involved, as Plato taught, in eternal, self-produced motion, from which
the motion of the body is derived. The pre-existence of the soul proves
its supra-sensible character, and its immortality.</p>
<p>Faustus: (Bishop of Regium, in Gaul, A. D. 470.) All created things
are matter; the soul being composed of air, God alone is
incorporeal.</p>
<p>Mamertus: (In reply to the bishop.) Man was made in the image of
God. Now, as there can be no likeness to God in matter, therefore it
must be found in the soul, therefore the soul is immaterial. The soul
is present in every part of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>the body as well as in the whole,
just as God is present in the whole universe, otherwise a part of it
would be lost when any portion of the body is cut off. The soul is not
contained in the body, but in reality contains it. Hence, it must be
immaterial, for no material substance can at once contain the body and
be within it as its animating principle.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas: (13th c.) The soul is the Actuality of body, as
heat, which is the source whence bodies are made hot, is not body, but
a sort of actuality of body. The soul of man is an independent
substance.</p>
<p>Duns Scotus: (13th c. British philosopher.) The soul is a created
something, the basis of all finite existence, including corporeal
matter itself.</p>
<p>Albert Magnus: (13th c.) Held that the active intellect is a part of
the soul, and is immortal by virtue of its community with God.</p>
<p>Gassendi: (French philosopher, 17th c.) There is no evidence of the
spirituality of the soul.</p>
<p>Malebranche: (Priest and philosopher, 17th c.) We see all in God,
who is in fact our soul.</p>
<p>Locke: (17th c.) Matter may think, and God may communicate thought
to matter.</p>
<p>Paracelsus: (15th c.) Taught there were four souls&mdash;vegetal,
sensitive, rational, and spiritual. Campanella demonstrates this last
by the fact that carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer.</p>
<p>Mansel: (&ldquo;Philosophy of Consciousness,&rdquo; p. 327.) We are
not authorized to say that we know the soul to be simple, and that,
therefore, it is indestructible; but only that we do not know the soul
to be compound, and, therefore, that we cannot infer its mortality from
the analogy of bodily dissolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck&rsquo;s Theo. Dic.&rdquo; defines soul: That vital,
immaterial, active substance, or principle in man, whereby he
perceives, remembers, reasons, and wills. It is rather to be described
as to its operations than to be defined as to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>its
essence. Various, indeed, have been the opinions of philosophers
concerning its substance.</p>
<p>Parkhurst: (A distinguished Hebrew lexicographer.) As a noun,
<i>nephesh</i> hath been supposed to signify the spiritual part of man,
or what we commonly call the soul. I must, for myself, confess that I
can find no passage where it hath undoubtedly this meaning.</p>
<p>Hobbes: Spirit is synonymous with ghost&mdash;a mere phantom of the
imagination.</p>
<p>Locke: (&ldquo;Understanding,&rdquo; p. 419.) We can no more know
that there are finite spirits really existing, by the idea we have of
such things in our minds, than by the ideas any one has of fairies, or
centaurs; he can come to know that things answering those ideas do
really exist.</p>
<p>Voltaire: The Greeks distinguish three sorts of
souls&mdash;<i>Psyche</i>, signifying the sensitive soul&mdash;the soul
of the senses; hence it was that Love, the son of Aphrodite, had so
much passion for Psyche, and that she loved him so tenderly.
<i>Pneuma</i>, the breath which gave life and motion to the whole
machine, and which we have rendered by
<i>spiritus</i>&mdash;spirit&mdash;a vague term which has received a
thousand different acceptations. And lastly, <i>Nous</i>, intelligence.
Thus we possess three souls, without having the slightest notion of any
of them.... What are we to think of a child with two heads, which is
otherwise well formed? Some say that it has two souls, because it is
furnished with two pineal glands, with two callous substances, with two
<i>sensoria communia</i>. Others answer, that there cannot be two souls
with but one breast and one navel.... The word soul is one of those
which everyone pronounces without understanding it. We understand those
things of which we have an idea, but we have no idea of
soul&mdash;spirit; therefore, we do not understand it.</p>
<p>John Calvin: The soul is an immortal essence, the nobler part of
man. It is a creation out of nothing, not an emanation; it is essence
without motion, not motion without essence. It is not properly bounded
by space, still it occupies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=
"#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>the body as a habitation,
animating its parts and endowing its organs for their several
functions.</p>
<p>Dugald Stewart: Although we have the strongest evidence that there
is a thinking and sentient principle within us, essentially distinct
from matter, yet we have no direct evidence of the possibility of this
principle exercising its various powers in a separate state from the
body. On the contrary, the union of the two, while it subsists, is
evidently of the most intimate nature.</p>
<p>Joseph Priestly: It being a rigid canon of the Newtonian logic not
to multiply causes without necessity, we should adhere to a single
substance until it be shown, which cannot be, that the properties of
mind are incompatible with the properties of matter. He was opposed to
protecting and perpetuating absurdity by dodging behind mystery. That
there is no difference between spiritual substance and nothing at all.
That the doctrine of a separate soul embarrasses the whole system of
Christianity.</p>
<p>McBeth: The times have been that when the brains were out the man
would die, and there an end.</p>
<p>Buchner: Experience and daily occupation teach us that the spirit
perishes with the material substratum&mdash;that man <i>dies</i>.
(&ldquo;Matter and Force.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Burmeister: That the soul of a deceased person does not re-appear
after death, is not contested by rational people. Spirits and ghosts
are only seen by diseased or superstitious individuals.</p>
<p>Vogt: Physiology decides definitely and categorically against
individual immortality, as against any special existence of the soul.
The soul does not enter the f&oelig;tus like the evil spirit into
persons possessed, but is a product of the development of the brain,
just as muscular activity is a product of muscular development. So soon
as the substances composing the brain are aggregated in a similar form,
will they exhibit the same functions. We have seen that we can destroy
mental activity by injuring the brain. By observing the development of
the child we also arrive at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href=
"#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>the conviction that the activity
of the soul progresses in proportion as the brain is gradually
developed. The f&oelig;tus manifests no mental activity, which only
shows itself after birth when the brain acquires the necessary material
condition. Mental activity changes with the period of life, and ceases
altogether at death.</p>
<p>Lecky: (&ldquo;Rat. in Europe,&rdquo; p. 341, v. I.) Not one of the
early fathers entertained the same opinion as the majority of
Christians do of the present day, that the soul is perfectly simple,
and entirely destitute of all body, figure, form, and extension. On the
contrary, they all acknowledged it to contain something corporeal,
although of a different kind and nature from the bodies of this mortal
sphere.... Tertullian mentions a woman who had seen a soul, which she
described as &ldquo;a transparent and lucid figure, in the perfect form
of a man.&rdquo; St. Anthony saw the soul of Ammon carried up to
heaven. The soul of a Libyan hermit named Marc was borne to heaven in a
napkin. Angels also were not unfrequently seen, and were universally
believed to have cohabited with the daughters of the antediluvians....
Sometimes the soul was portrayed as a sexless child, rising out of the
mouth of the corpse.</p>
<p>John Meslier: (&ldquo;Testimony of a Dying Priest.&rdquo;) The
barbarians, like all ignorant men, attribute to spirits all the effects
of which their inexperience prevents them from discovering the true
causes. Ask a barbarian what causes your watch to move, he will answer,
&ldquo;A spirit.&rdquo; Ask our philosophers what moves the universe,
they will tell you, &ldquo;It is a spirit.&rdquo; Ask a theologian what
he means by a spirit. He will answer that it is an unknown substance,
which is perfectly simple, which has nothing tangible, nothing in
common with matter. In good faith, is there any mortal who can form the
least idea of such a substance.</p>
<p>James F. Ferrier: (Institutes of Metaphysics.) In vain does the
Spiritualist found an argument for the existence of a separate
immaterial substance on the alleged incompatibility of the intellectual
and physical phenomena to co-inhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>in the same
sub-stratum. Materiality may very well stand the brunt of that
unshotted broadside. This mild artifice can scarcely expect to be
treated as a serious observation. Such a hypothesis cannot be meant to
be in earnest. Who is to dictate to nature what phenomena, or what
qualities inhere in what substances; what effects may result from what
causes? Matter is already in the field as an acknowledged
entity&mdash;this both parties admit. Mind, considered as an
independent entity, is not so unmistakably in the field. Therefore as
entities are not to be multiplied without necessity, we are not
entitled to postulate a new cause, so long as it is possible to account
for the phenomena by a cause already in existence; which possibility
has never yet been disproved.</p>
<p>Draper: (John William.) Chemistry furnishes us with a striking
example of the doctrine of Diogenes of Apollonia, that the air is
actually a spiritual being; for, on the discovery of several of the
gases by the early experimenters, they were not only regarded as of a
spiritual nature, but actually received the name under which they pass
to this day, <i>gheist</i> or gas, from a belief that they were ghosts.
(&ldquo;Int. Dev.,&rdquo; p. 103, v. 1.)</p>
<p>W. R. Grove: (&ldquo;Correlation and Conservation of Forces,&rdquo;
p. 103.) The ancients when they witnessed natural phenomenon, removed
from ordinary analogies, and unexplained by any mechanical action known
to them, referred it to a soul, a spiritual or preternatural power:
thus amber and the magnet were supposed by Thales to have a soul; the
functions of digestion, assimilation, etc., were supposed by Paracelsus
to be effected by a spirit (the Arch&aelig;us). Air and gases were also
at first deemed spiritual, but subsequently became invested with a more
material character, and the word gas, from geist, a ghost or spirit,
affords us an instance of the gradual transmission of a spiritual into
a physical conception.</p>
<p>Buchner: Now, in the same manner as the steam engine produces
motion, so does the organic complication of force-endowed materials
produce in the animal body a sum of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>effects, so
interwoven as to become a unit, and is then by us called spirit, soul,
thought.</p>
<p>Taylor: Mr. Darwin saw two Malay women in Keeling Island, who had a
wooden spoon dressed in clothes like a doll. This spoon had been
carried to the grave of a dead man, and becoming inspired at full moon,
in fact lunatic, it danced about convulsively like a table or a hat at
a modern spirit-<i>seance</i>. (&ldquo;Early History of Mankind,&rdquo;
p. 139, v. 2.) Savages believe that their pots, kettles, pans, etc.,
have souls. His knives, tobacco-pipes, the winds, water, fire, storm,
etc., have souls.</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson: (&ldquo;Oriental Religions,&rdquo; p. 543.) Various
North-American tribes believe that the soul of a dying person may be
drawn into the bosom of a sterile woman, or blown by the breath into
that of the nearest relative, and so come again to birth in the way
that the receiver desires.</p>
<p>Theodore Parker, John Wesley, Jeremy Taylor, Coleridge, Lamartine,
Agassiz, and hosts of other men well known to fame, taught that animals
as well as men, had immortal souls.</p>
<p>Brodie: (President of the Royal Society, 1858.) The mind of animals
is essentially the same as that of man. Every one familiar with the dog
will admit that that creature knows right from wrong, and is conscious
when he has committed a fault.</p>
<p>Du Bois-Reymond: With awe and wonder must the student of nature
regard that microscopic molecule of nervous substance which is the seat
of the laborious, constructive, orderly, loyal, dauntless soul of the
ant. It has developed itself to its present state through a countless
series of generations.</p>
<p>John Fiske: But the propriety of identifying soul and breath, which
really quits the body at its decease, has furnished the chief name for
the soul, not only to the Hebrew, the Sanskrit, and the classic
tongues; not only to German and English, where <i>geist</i>, and
<i>ghost</i>, according to Max Muller, have the meaning of
&ldquo;breath,&rdquo; and are akin to such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>words as <i>gas</i>, <i>gust</i>, and
<i>geyser</i>; but also to numerous barbaric languages. (&ldquo;Myths
and Myth-Makers,&rdquo; p. 225.) The belief in wraiths <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e7971" title="Source: was">has</span> survived into
modern times, and now and then appears in that remnant of primeval
philosophy known as &ldquo;Spiritualism,&rdquo; as for example, in the
case of the lady who &ldquo;thought she saw her own father look in at
the church window at the moment he was dying at his own house.&rdquo;
(Ib., p. 229.) The Kamtchadales expressly declare that all animals,
even flies and bugs, will live after death,&mdash;a belief, which, in
our day, has been indorsed on philosophical grounds by an eminent
living naturalist. (Ib., 230.) [Mr. Fiske refers to Agassiz.]</p>
<p>M. Figuier: Human souls are for the most part the surviving souls of
deceased animals; in general, the souls of precocious children like
Mozart come from nightingales, while the souls of great architects have
passed into them from beavers, and etc., etc. (&ldquo;The To-morrow of
Death,&rdquo; p. 247.)</p>
<p>W. Lauder Lindsay: By no kind of scientific evidence can it be
proved that soul exists, whether in man or other animals.... Nor should
it be forgotten that, according to many writers, the word or term
&ldquo;soul&rdquo; is regarded as synonymous with &ldquo;mind,&rdquo;
in which case there can be no question as to its possession by the
higher animals. While the term &ldquo;soul&rdquo; has also been
applied&mdash;in figurative senses no doubt&mdash;even to plants.
(&ldquo;Mind in the Lower Animals,&rdquo; v. 1, p. 101.) It obviously
lies with those who assert dogmatically that all men have immortal
souls, while no animals possess them, to reconcile with such a
conviction the provable fact that many animals are superior to many
men, not only in general intelligence, but also as regards moral sense
and religious feeling. (Ib.) Ideas of justice or right, feelings of
decency or shame, that combination or essence of moral qualities known
as conscience, are as certainly present in some animals as they appear
to be absent in countless numbers of men. (Ib., p. 103.) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ernst Haeckel: The final result of this comparison is this: That
between the most highly developed animal souls, and the lowest
developed human souls there exists only a small quantitative, but no
qualitative difference, and this difference is much less than the
difference between the lowest and the highest human souls, or than the
difference between the lowest and the highest animal souls.
(&ldquo;Hist. of Creation,&rdquo; v. 2, p. 362.) Some of the wildest
tribes, of men, in Southern Asia and Eastern Africa have no trace
whatever of the first foundations of all human civilization of family
life, and marriage. They live together, in herds, like apes, generally
climbing on trees and eating fruits; they do not know of fire, and use
stones and clubs as weapons, just like the higher apes. (Ib., p.
363.)</p>
<p>Descartes: (17 c.) Matter, whose essence is extension, is known by
the senses; mind, whose essence is thinking, can be known only by
self-consciousness. The thinking principle is immaterial.</p>
<p>Origen: The nature of the soul is such as to make her capable of
existing eternally, backward as well as forward, because her spiritual
essence, as such, makes it impossible that she should, either through
age or violence, be dissolved.</p>
<p>Rev. Joseph Baylee, D. D.: (Principal of St. Aidan&rsquo;s College,
Birkenhead, England.) Man is eternal. He was in existence before he was
born; sinned before he was born, and if he had never been born would
have suffered eternal damnation for that sin. (Dis. on God and the
Bible between Dr. Baylee and Mr. Bradlaugh.)</p>
<p>Draper: (&ldquo;Conflict,&rdquo; p. 127.) Moreover, to many devout
persons there is something very revolting in the suggestion that the
Almighty is a servitor to the caprices and lusts of men, and that at a
certain term after its origin, it is necessary for him to create for
the embryo a soul.</p>
<p>Vedic Theology: The soul is a particle of that all-pervading
principle, the Universal Intellect, or Soul of the World, detached for
a while from its primitive source; and placed in connection with the
bodily frame, but destined, by an inevitably <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>as
rivers run back to be lost in the ocean from whence they arose.</p>
<p>The Bible: As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that
goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. (<a class=

pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity. All go unto one place,
all are of the dust and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the spirit
of man that goeth upward; and the spirit of the beast that goeth

<p>Having thus successfully responded to the interrogatory, What is the
soul? that is to say, the constituent thereof, let us now very briefly
settle the <i lang="la">locus in quo</i>:</p>
<p>Plato: The soul is located in the brain.</p>
<p>Aristotle: The soul is located in the heart.</p>
<p>Heraclitus: The soul is located in the blood.</p>
<p>Epicurus: The soul is located in the chest.</p>
<p>Critios: The soul is located in the blood.</p>
<p>Sommering: The soul is located in the ventricles.</p>
<p>Kant: The soul is located in the water contained in the
ventricles.</p>
<p>Plotinus: The body is located in the soul, and not the soul in the
body.</p>
<p>Ennemoser: The whole body is the seat of the soul.</p>
<p>Fischer: The soul is located in the nervous system. <span class=

<p>Ficinus: The soul is located in the heart.</p>
<p>Descartes: The soul is located in the pineal gland.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e8043" title=

<p>Willis: The soul is located in the <i>corpora striata</i>.</p>
<p>Vieussens: The soul is located in the <i>centrum ovale</i>.</p>
<p>Boerhaave: The soul is located on the boundary line of the gray and

<p>Mayer: The soul is located in the <i>medulla oblongata</i>.</p>
<p>Camper: The soul is located in the pineal gland, <i>nates</i> and

<p>Dohoney: Scientifically speaking, man is a threefold being: body,
soul, and spirit. The home of the spirit is the <i>cerebrum</i>, while
the seat of the soul is the <i>cerebellum</i>. (&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; p.
118.)</p>
<p>La Pieronie: The dwelling place of the soul is in the callous
body.</p>
<p>Buchner: Some authors imagine that the soul, under certain
circumstances, leaves the brain for a short time and occupies another
part of the nervous system. The solar plexus, a concatenation of
sympathetic nerves, situated in the abdomen, was especially pointed out
as the favored spot. (&ldquo;Force and Matter,&rdquo; p. 195.)</p>
<p>Prochaska: Assumed that the <i>cerebrum</i> and the
<i>cerebellum</i> were the seat of &ldquo;soul sensations,&rdquo; and
the <i>sensorium commune</i> the seat of &ldquo;body
sensations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whytt: As the schoolmen supposed the Deity to exist in every
<i>ubi</i> but not in any place, which is to say in Latin that he
exists everywhere, but in English nowhere, so they imagined the soul of
man not to occupy space, but to exist in an indivisible point.</p>
<p>Prof. Erdmann: The theory that the soul has its seat in the brain,
must lead to the result that when the body is separated from the head,
the soul should continue to exist.</p>
<p>Fortlage: There are certain errors in the human mind. The error of
the seat of the soul in the brain is one of them.</p>
<p>McCulloch says, in his able work on the &ldquo;Credibility of the
Scriptures&rdquo;: There is no word in the Hebrew language <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>that
signifies either soul or spirit, in the technical sense in which we use
the terms, as implying something distinct from the body.
(&ldquo;Credibility of Scriptures,&rdquo; p. 491, v. 2.)</p>
<p>Kitto, in his &ldquo;Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature,&rdquo;
renders <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

life: and <i>the man</i> became a <i>living animal</i>.</p>
<p>Bishop Tilotson says: The immortality of the soul is rather
<i>supposed</i>, or taken for granted, than expressly revealed in the
Bible.</p>
<p>The Egyptian doctrine of the soul is one of the most important, as
it is the most ancient, for this nation seems to have been the first to

<h3 class="main">IMMORTALITY.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is still another question. Why should God, a
being of infinite tenderness, leave the question of immortality in
doubt? How is it that there is nothing in the Old Testament on this
subject? Why is it that he who made all the constellations did not put
in his heaven the star of hope? How do you account for the fact that
you do not find in the Old Testament, from the first mistake in Genesis
to the last curse in Malachi, a funeral service? Is it not strange that
some one in the Old Testament did not stand by an open grave of father
or mother and say, &ldquo;We shall meet again&rdquo;? Was it because
the divinely inspired men did not know? You taunt me by saying that I
know no more of the immortality of the soul than Cicero knew. I admit
it. I know no more than the lowest savage, no more than a doctor of
divinity, that is to say, nothing.&mdash;Ingersoll, Ingersoll-Field
Discussion.</p>
<p>Some urge that the soul is life. What is life? Is it not the word by
which we express the aggregate normal functional activity of vegetable
and animal organisms, necessarily differing in degree, if not in kind,
with each different organization? To talk of immortal life, and yet to
admit the decay and destruction of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>the organization, is much the
same as to talk of a square circle. You link together two words which
contradict each other. The solution of the soul problem is not so
difficult as many imagine. The greatest difficulty is, that we have
been trained to use certain words as &ldquo;God,&rdquo;
&ldquo;matter,&rdquo; &ldquo;mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo;
&ldquo;soul,&rdquo; &ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; and we have been
further trained to take these words as representatives of realities,
which in fact, they do not represent. We have to unlearn much of our
school lore. We have specially to carefully examine the meaning of each
word we use. I am told that the mind and the body are separate from one
another. Are the brightness and steel of the knife separate? Is not
brightness the quality attaching to a certain modification of
existence&mdash;steel? Is not intelligence a quality attaching to a
certain modification of existence&mdash;man? The word brightness has no
meaning, except as relating to some bright thing. The word
intelligence, no meaning, except as relating to some intelligent thing.
I take some water and drop it upon the steel, in due course the process
of oxidation takes place, and the brightness is gone. I drop into a
man&rsquo;s brain a bullet; the process of the destruction of life
takes place, and his intelligence is gone. By changing the state of the
steel we destroy its brightness, and by disorganizing the man destroy
his intelligence. Is mind an entity or result? an existence or a
condition? Surely it is but the result of organic activity, a
phenomenon of animal life. (&ldquo;Has Man a Soul?&rdquo; Charles
Bradlaugh.)</p>

<p>The idea of immortality, like the great sea, has ebbed and flowed in
the human heart, beating its countless waves of hope and joy against
the shores of time, and was not born of an book, nor of any religion,
nor of any creed; it was born of human affection, and will continue to
ebb and flow beneath the clouds and mists of doubt and darkness as long
as love kisses the lips of death. It is the rainbow of hope shining
upon the tears of grief. We love, therefore we wish to live, and the
foundation of the idea of immortality is human affection and human
love, and I have a thousand times more confidence in the affections of
the human heart, in the deep and splendid feelings of the human soul
than I have in any book that ever was or ever can be written by mortal
man.&mdash;Ingersoll.</p>

<h4 class="main">Is This Life the &ldquo;Be-all and
End-all?&rdquo;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To answer that question, or to give my views on the
subject as to whether man lives after death or is extinguished as a
living <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>being by death, would ordinarily involve a long
preliminary discourse; but I think I can give you my views, such as
they are, in a few words. Life is sensation, sensibility, the power of
feeling. Without sensation there is no life. We feel with our nerves;
we see with our eyes; we hear with our ears. Without nerves there would
be no feeling, without eyes no seeing, without ears no hearing. These
senses, therefore, of feeling, seeing, hearing, exist in combination
with certain forms of matter, and cannot exist without such
combination. So the mind exists in combination with the matter, brain.
Without the brain there can be no mental phenomena, no thinking, no
perceiving. These things are palpable; they are truths which may not be
disputed. Therefore, if death destroys our nerves, it destroys our
power of feeling; if it destroys our eyes, it destroys our power of
seeing; if it destroys our ears, it destroys our power of hearing; if
it destroys our brain, it destroys our power of thinking and
perceiving. The man lies down, feeling nothing, seeing nothing, knowing
nothing; he is a corpse. Separated from the brain, the mind cannot act,
cannot think, cannot conceive; therefore, if it exists at all, it is
the same as if it were dead. In that condition, the mind can no more
think or perceive than the dust into which the decomposed nerves have
fallen can feel. What follows then? That the man has come to an end,
entirely; he is extinguished.&mdash;Selected.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>So you must equally bear with the comparatively small number of
scientists who, within the last three hundred years, have worked out
the hypothesis that the soul is not matter, substance, or entity, at
all, but simply the continuous action or process of the nervous systems
of animals, and especially of the brain of man, in answer to their
environment. In a word, the life, soul, spirit, mind, thought, feeling,
and consciousness are but varying tones of the music which our nervous
systems give out when the world plays upon them&mdash;much as the piano
answers to the touch of our hands. The music was not in, nor the
property of the piano, nor of the hand, but it arises and exists only
by reason of the playing-contact of the two. Thus the life or soul is
not a property of brain-matter<span class="corr" id="xd21e8158" title=
"Source: .">,</span> or of our nerves, nor of the world or its
impinging force; but when those world forces by touch, heat, light,
electricity and foods do reach so as to act upon the nerves and brain,
then comes their reaction, and we call that reaction feeling, life,
soul, thought, reason, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=

<h4 class="main">Materialism&mdash;Prof. Tyndall.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If Materialism is confounded, science is rendered
dumb.... Materialism, therefore, is not a thing to be mourned over, but
to be honestly considered; accepted if wholly true, rejected if false.
(&ldquo;Fragments of Science,&rdquo; p. 221.) It ought to be known and
avowed that the physical philosopher, as such, must be a pure
Materialist. His inquiries deal with matter and force, and with them
alone. (Ib., p. 72.) As regards knowledge, physical science is polar.
(Ib., p. 52.) It is the advance of [this] knowledge that has given a
materialistic color to the philosophy of our age. (Ib., p. 222.) We may
fear and scorn Materialism; but he who knew all about it, and could
apply his knowledge, might become the preacher of a new gospel. (Ib.,
p. 221.)</p>
<p>Through our neglect of the monitions of a reasonable Materialism, we
sin and suffer daily. (Ib., p. 224.) The practical monitions are plain
enough which declare that on our dealings with matter depend our weal
or woe, physical and moral. (Ib., p. 222.) It is our duty not to
shirk&mdash;it ought rather to be our privilege to accept, the
established results of physical inquiries; for here, assuredly, our
ultimate weal depends upon our loyalty to truth. Is mind degraded by
this recognition of its dependence [on matter]? Assuredly not. Matter,
on the contrary, is raised to the level it ought to occupy, and from
which timid ignorance would remove it. (Ib., p. 221.)</p>
<p>Matter is not that empty capacity which philosophers and theologians
have pictured it, but the universal mother, who brings forth all things
as the fruit of her own womb. Nature is seen to do all things
spontaneously, without the meddling of the gods. (Ib., p. 193.) Matter
I define as that mysterious thing by which all that is, is
accomplished. How it came to have the power which it possesses is a
question on which I never ventured an opinion. (Ib., p. 193.) I discern
in matter the promise and potency of all terrestrial life. (Ib., p.
251.)</p>
<p>Does life belong to what we call matter, or is it an independent
principle infused into matter at some suitable epoch? (Ib., p. 131.)
There does not exist a barrier, possessing the strength of a cobweb, in
opposition to the hypothesis which ascribes the appearance of life to
that &ldquo;potency of matter&rdquo; which finds its expression in
natural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>evolution.... Divorced from matter, where is
life? (Ib., p. 192.) To man, as we know him, matter is necessary to
consciousness. (Ib., p. 192.) Every meal we eat, and every cup we
drink, illustrates the mysterious control of mind by matter. (Ib., p.
50.)</p>
<p>If these statements startle, it is because matter has been defined
and maligned by philosophers and theologians, who were ignorant alike
of its mystical and transcendental powers. (Ib., p. 51.) Two courses,
and two only, are possible: either let us open our doors freely to the
conception of creative acts, or, abandoning them let us radically
change our notions of matter. (Ib., p. 191.) Without this total
revolution of the notions now prevalent, the evolution hypothesis must
stand condemned. (Ib., p. 133.)</p>
<p>If we look at matter as defined by our scientific text-books, the
notion of conscious life coming out of it cannot be formed by the mind.
(Ib., p. 191.) Spirit and matter have ever been present to us in the
rudest contrast: the one as all noble, the other as all vile. But is
this correct? Upon the answer to this question, all depends. (Ib., p.
133.) #/</p>
<p>Physiology proves Materialism to be true, and the following
testimony to that fact by eminent scientific men is only a small part
of what might be quoted of similar tenor:</p>
<p>Bain tells us: The most careful and studied observations of
physiologists have shown <i>beyond question</i>, that the brain as a
whole is indispensible to thought, feeling, and volition.</p>
<p>Dr. Ferrier says: The brain is the organ of mind, and that mental
operations are possible only in and through it. This fact is so well
established that we may start from it as we should from any ultimate
fact.</p>
<p>Prof. Virchow, of Berlin, says: Every one must admit that without a
brain, nay, more, without a good and well developed brain, the human
mind has <i>no</i> existence.&mdash;Man has a mind and rational
<i>will</i> only in as much and in so far as he possesses a brain.</p>
<p>Huxley says: What we call the operations of the mind are
<i>functions</i> of the <i>brain</i>, and the materials of
consciousness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>are products of <i>cerebral activity</i>.
Sensations are products of the inherent <i>properties</i> of the
thinking organ.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Tyndall says: We believe that every thought and every feeling has
its definite mechanical correlative in the nervous system; that it is
accompanied by a certain separation and remarshalling of the atoms of
the brain.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Dr. Maudsley says: I do not go beyond what facts warrant, when I say
that, when a thought occurs in the mind, there <i>necessarily</i>
occurs a correlative change in the gray matter of the brain. Without
it, the thought could not arise; with it, it can not fail to rise.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">What is matter! I take a handful of earth in my hands,
and into that dust I put seeds, and arrows from the eternal quiver of
the sun smite it, and the seeds grow and bud and blossom, and fill the
air with perfume in my sight. Do you understand that? Do you understand
how this dust and these seeds and that light and this moisture produced
that bud and that flower and that perfume? Do you understand that any
better than you do the production of thought? Do you understand that
any better than you do a dream? Do you understand that any better than
you do the thoughts of love that you see in the eyes of the one you
adore? Can you explain it? Can you tell what matter is? Have you the
slightest conception? Yet you talk about matter as though you were
acquainted with its origin; as though you had compelled, with clenched
hands, the very rocks to give up the secret of existence. Do you know
what force is? Can you account for molecular action? Are you familiar
with chemistry? Can you account for the loves and hatreds of the atoms?
Is there not something in matter that forever eludes you? Can you tell
what matter really is? Before you cry Materialism, you had better find
what matter is. Can you tell of anything without a material basis? Is
it possible to imagine the annihilation of a single atom? Is it
possible for you to conceive of the creation of a single atom? Can you
have a thought that is not suggested to you by what you call matter?
Did any man or woman or child ever have a solitary thought, dream or
conception, that was not suggested to them by something they had seen
in nature?&mdash;Ingersoll.</p>

<h4 class="main">The Origin of Belief in the Soul.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">* * * I had waited at some distance, and as the day
grew stronger, saw that this new grave was not the only one upon that
lonely height.</p>
<p>On my right was a mound on which lay the betel-box, the pipe, the
haversack, and &ldquo;dah&rdquo; (or chopper-knife) that in life had
been his who lay beneath. I turned to rest on the trunk of a fallen
tree, when I heard the sound of footsteps. The childless man and woman
were passing. I knew the man, and I spoke to him. He had often been my
guide in former visits to his village. He stopped. His wife passed on.
I asked, tenderly I hope, as to his child. What was the cause of
death?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fever.&rdquo; Then he squatted down, drew out his pipe,
filled and lit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose grave is that?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to the mound
with the betel-box and &ldquo;dah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the men of my village,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;he
died some months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you leave his betel-box, haversack, and
&lsquo;dah&rsquo; on the grave? What use can it be to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His &lsquo;lah&rsquo; (spirit) will require them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see his &lsquo;lah&rsquo; has not taken them. They
are still there, and they are rotting away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Very promptly. &ldquo;What you see are only
the forms of the things. Their &lsquo;lahs&rsquo; have gone away and
are with the man&rsquo;s &lsquo;lah.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another world below this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so people&rsquo;s &lsquo;lahs&rsquo; after death go to
another world and work as in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and if they had no haversack, and no betel-box, and no
&lsquo;dah&rsquo; how would they get on? How could they cut down forest
and cultivate rice for food if they had no
&lsquo;dah&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added after a pause:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So our people say, but I don&rsquo;t know. I am ignorant. I
am only a poor jungle fowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I persisted, &ldquo;how do your people know that
it is true&mdash;that the betel-box, the haversack, the knife, and
other things have &lsquo;lahs,&rsquo; or even that the man has a
&lsquo;lah&rsquo;?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Karen was silent for a while. Then he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child is dead&mdash;his body is buried there. It can not
move and go about; yet I know that in my sleep he will come to me. He
will speak, and I shall speak to him. It is not his body but his
&lsquo;lah&rsquo; that will come. So also I lost an ax long ago. It
fell in the forest somewhere. I could not find it, but in my sleep I
have seen its &lsquo;lah&rsquo; and have held it in my hand.&rdquo; He
paused, and went on: &ldquo;It must have a &lsquo;lah,&rsquo; for iron
and handle have rotted away long ago, yet I held them last night in my
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the &lsquo;lah&rsquo; lives independently of the
body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Our people say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was silent. Here among these savages I saw how the germs of belief
in a future life are laid, from what delusion they spring.</p>
<p>Then looking back to the far-off times, when the ancestors of our
own now civilized race were savages with minds as undeveloped as that
of the savage before me, I saw how from the mystery of
dream-appearances rose the belief in the dual nature of things. I saw
how this belief, extending first to all things animate and inanimate,
came in the slow evolution of man&rsquo;s intellect, by the elimination
of the grosser and cruder portion of his thought to hold at length only
of living things.</p>
<p>No profound thought&mdash;no deep insight into human nature is
needed to trace along general lines its further development.</p>
<p>Man in his selfish egoism making himself the center of all nature,
has deemed that he alone is thus favored and raised above the rest of
the universe.</p>
<p>Moreover it is a belief that with all its uncertainties has an
intrinsic attractive beauty in the hope it gives to man, that love and
happiness will last beyond the grave.</p>
<p>Above all&mdash;fatalest of all, it is a belief that offers to the
craft of the priest, power over his fellow man.</p>
<p>Thus, flattering to man&rsquo;s self-love, useful as an engine of
power, affording an easy explanation of mysteries in life and death,
this belief in a soul really rising in &ldquo;the mists and shadows of
sleep,&rdquo; has come down to us as god-revealed from on
high.&mdash;C. T. Bingham, in &ldquo;Progress,&rdquo; London,
England.</p>

peculiar. As we were contemplating him, he stopped to look in a store

&ldquo;Where has Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s gait gone since he stopped
walking?&rdquo; He very candidly acknowledged that a man&rsquo;s gait
was not a thing, not an entity, but a mode of motion, and that when the
body ceased to move, there was no gait. I asked him if thinking (the
soul) was not a motion or activity of the brain, and that when it
ceased to act, if there was any soul or thinking left. I have a very

<h2 class="main">DESIGN ARGUMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nothing could have come by chance, it is said, and
therefore it is inferred that this universe must have been created by a
God.</p>
<p>Let us view this famous argument for a moment. God is something or
nothing. To say he is nothing is to say there is no God. If he is
something, he is not merely a property or quality, but an existence
<i>per se</i>&mdash;an entity, a substance, whether material or
immaterial is unimportant. If he is a substance, a material, or
spiritual being, there must be order, harmony, and adaptation, or
fitness, in his divine nature, to enable him to perceive, reflect,
design, and execute his plans. If Deity does not reason, does not
cogitate, but perceives truth without the labor of investigation and
contrivance, he must still possess an adaptation or fitness thus to
perceive, as well as to execute his design.</p>
<p>To say God is without order, harmony, and adaptation, or fitness, is
to say he is a mere chaos&mdash;worse than that imaginary chaos that
theologians tell us would result if divine agency were withdrawn from
the universe. If a being without order, harmony, and adaptation, or a
divine chaos, can create an orderly universe then there is no
consistency in saying that unintelligent matter could not have produced
the objects that we behold. If order, harmony, and adaptation do exist
in the divine mind (or in the substance which produces thought, power,
and purpose in the divine mind) they must be eternal, for that which
constitutes the essential <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>nature of a God must be the
eternal basis of his being. If the order, harmony, and adaptation in
God are co-existent with him, are eternal, they must be independent of
design, for that which never began to exist could not have been
produced, and does not therefore admit of design. If order, harmony,
and adaptation are independent of design in the divine mind, it is
certain that order, harmony, and adaptation exist, and are not evidence
of a pre-existent, designing intelligence.</p>
<p>If order, harmony, and adaptation exist, which were not produced by
design, which are therefore <span class="corr" id="xd21e8375" title=
"Source: no">not</span> evidence of design, it is unreasonable and
illogical to infer designing intelligence from the fact alone that
order, harmony, and adaptation exist in nature. Therefore an
intelligent Deity cannot be inferred from the order, harmony, and
adaptation in nature. If the order, harmony, and adaptation in Deity,
to produce his thoughts, and to execute his plans, are eternal, why may
not the formation of matter into worlds, and the evolutions of the
various forms of vegetable and animal life on this globe be the result
of the ceaseless action of self-existent matter in accordance with an
inherent eternal principle of adaptation? Is it more reasonable to
suppose the universe was created, or constructed by a being in whom
exists the most wonderful order and harmony, and the most admirable
adaptation to construct a universe (which order, harmony, and
adaptation could have had no designing cause), than to suppose that the
universe itself in its entirety is eternal, and the self-producing
cause of all the manifestations we behold?</p>
<p>Is a God uncaused, and who made everything from nothing, more easy
of belief than a universe uncaused and existing according to its own
inherent nature? Is it wonderful that matter should be self-existent;
that it should possess the power to form suns, planets, and construct
that beautiful ladder of life that reaches from the lowest forms of the
vegetable kingdom up to man? How much more wonderful that a great being
should exist, without any cause, who had no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>beginning, and who is infinitely more admirable
than the universe itself.</p>
<p>Again, the plan of a work is as much evidence of intelligence and
design as the work which embodies the plan. The plan of a steam engine
in the mind of Fitch&mdash;the plan of the locomotive in the mind of
Stephenson&mdash;was as much evidence of design as the piece of
machinery after its mechanical construction. If God be an omniscient
being&mdash;a being who knows everything; to whose knowledge no
addition can be made&mdash;his plans must be eternal&mdash;without
beginning, and therefore uncaused. If God&rsquo;s plans are not
eternal; if from time to time new plans originate in his mind, there
must be an addition to his knowledge, and if his knowledge admits of
addition, it must be finite. But if his plans had no beginning; if,
like himself, they are eternal, they must, like him, be independent of
design. Now, the plan of a thing, we have already seen, is as much
evidence of design as the object which embodies the plan. Since the
plans of Deity are no proof of design that produced them (for they are
supposed to be eternal), the plan of this universe, of course, was no
evidence of a designing intelligence that produced it. But since the
plan of the universe is as much evidence of design as the universe
itself, and since the former is no evidence of design, it follows that
design cannot be inferred from the existence of the universe.</p>
<p>The absurdity of the <i>a posteriori</i> argument of a God consists
in the assumption that what we call order and adaptation in nature are
evidence of design, when it is evident that whether there be a God or
not, order and adaptation must have existed from eternity, and are not
therefore necessarily proof of a designing cause. The reasoning of the
theologian is like that of the Hindoo in accounting for the position of
the earth. &ldquo;Whatever exists must have some support,&rdquo; said
he. The earth exists, and is therefore supported. He imagined it
resting on the back of an elephant. The elephant needing some support,
he supposed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>rested on the back of a huge tortoise. He forgot
that according to his own premise that whatever exists must have some
support, that the tortoise should rest on something. The
inconclusiveness of his reasoning is apparent to a child. Whatever
exists is supported. The earth exists. Therefore, the earth is
supported; it rests on an elephant; the elephant rests on a tortoise;
the tortoise exists, but nothing is said about its support.</p>
<p>The theologian says order, harmony, and adaptation are evidence of a
designing intelligence that produced them. The earth and its
productions show order, harmony, and adaptation. Therefore, the earth
and its productions have been produced by an intelligent designer. Just
as the Hindoo stopped reasoning when he imagined the earth on an
elephant, and the elephant on a tortoise, so the theologian stops
reasoning when he says, God made the world. But as surely as from the
premise that whatever exists must have some support, follows the
conclusion that the tortoise rests on something, as rests on it the
elephant, does it follow from the proposition that order, harmony, and
adaptation are proof of an intelligent designer, that the order,
harmony, and adaptation in the Deity to produce the effects ascribed to
him are evidence of an intelligent designer who made him, as the
various parts of nature, adapted to one another, are evidence of an
intelligent designer that produced them. This reasoning leads to the
conclusion that there has been an infinite succession of creative and
created Gods, which is inconsistent with the idea of a First Cause, the
creator of the universe. Then why attempt to explain the mysteries of
the universe by imagining a God who produced everything but himself,
and why argue from the order and fitness in the world the existence of
a designer. It reminds me of the ostrich, that having buried its head
in the sand, so as to render invisible its pursuers, fancies there is
no further need of exertion to escape from the dangers and difficulties
which surround it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243"

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Design represented as a search after final
cause, until we come to a first cause, and then stop,&rdquo; says F. N.
Newman, &ldquo;is an argument I confess which in itself brings me no
satisfaction.&rdquo; &ldquo;The attempt,&rdquo; says Buckle,
&ldquo;which Paley and others have made to solve this mystery by rising
from the laws to the cause are evidently futile, because to the eye of
reason the solution is as incomprehensible as the problem, and the
arguments of the natural theologian, in so far as they are arguments,
must depend on reason.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Design implies the use of means for the attainment of ends. Man
designs, plans, contrives and uses secondary agencies to accomplish his
purposes, because unable to attain his ends directly. But how absurd to
speak of contrivance and design in a being of infinite power and
knowledge. Man, to build steamships has to fell trees and hew them into
various shapes, get iron from the earth and smelt it in furnaces, and
work it into bolts, braces, nails, etc., hundreds of workmen,
carpenters, joiners, blacksmiths, cabinet-makers, painters, caulkers,
riggers, etc., labor for months before the vessel can be launched. If
man possessed the power to speak into existence a steamship, would he
contrive, plan and use means to construct it? On the contrary, would it
not come instantly into existence as a complete, perfect whole?</p>
<p>But the existence of a steamer, since it is only a means to an end,
would be inconsistent with unlimited power in man. If he were able to
effect his purposes why should he construct a vessel with which to
visit far off lands? Infinite power would enable him to cross the ocean
by the mere exercise of his will. It is evident at a glance that the
use of means is incompatible with infinite knowledge and infinite
power. This argument ... in proving too much proves nothing, and
demonstrates its own worthlessness, and therefore we cast it aside.
Design implies finiteness; man designs and has to calculate and use
means to accomplish his end. If he were all powerful would he use that
power to construct ships to cross the ocean, or armies to win battles,
when he could accomplish his end without, and by those means
demonstrate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>that he is infinite in power? An infinite being
would not have to employ means to complete his works; he would not have
to doubt and cogitate before he accomplished his design; that would be
the method of man. It is absurd to suppose that a God did all those
things. We supposed God infinite in everything, in his power, in his
love and kindness. He has power to do everything. And yet the world is
so constructed that at every step we take we crush to death creatures
as minutely and curiously formed as ourselves. They kill one another in
numerous struggles, and life has been such a series of bloody battles,
resulting in destruction of life, that the Waterloos and Solferinos of
history are nothing in comparison. Where is the design in the volcano
that belches forth its fiery billows and buries in ruins a Pompeii and
a Herculaneum? Where is the design in the tornado that sends a fleet
with its precious freight of humanity beneath the remorseless waves?
Where is the design in the suffering and torture that thousands feel
this very moment in the chambers of sickness, and in the hospitals full
of diseases? Where is the evidence of a great being who has the power
to make men happy, and yet allows the world to go on in all its
misery&mdash;such misery as it makes one&rsquo;s heart ache to see, and
which we, imperfect creatures as we are, would gladly stop if we
could?</p>
<p>And where is the design in the thousands of facts which science has
brought to light, showing that there are organs and parts that serve no
purpose at all, but on the contrary, are injurious to their possessors?
Why do some animals, like the dugong, have tusks that never cut through
the gums? Why has the guinea pig teeth that are shed before it is born?
Science tells us these rudimentary structures are the remnants of a
former state, in which these parts were of service; but theology, which
requires us to believe that a God made all these animals as we now see
them, cannot possibly reconcile these facts with infinite wisdom and
goodness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>Adaptation in organisms instead of having been produced by a Deity,
we hold is largely the result of natural selection. Adaptation must
exist as the adjustment of objects to their environments. If a flock of
sheep be exposed to the weather of a severe climate, those of them
having the thinnest wool, affording the least protection from the cold,
will perish. Those with the thickest wool and hardiest nature will
survive every year, and by the law of heredity, transmit their
favorable variations. By this process those best adapted to the climate
live, and the others perish. Thus in the struggle for life we have the
&ldquo;survival of the fittest,&rdquo; without any design whatever. But
the theologian comes along and looking at the sheep, says: &ldquo;See
how God has adapted these sheep to the climate.&rdquo; He forgets the
thousands that have shivered and perished in winter&rsquo;s cold as the
condition of this adaptation. So animals change the color of their
coverings in accordance with their environments. The bears among the
icebergs of the North are white, because in the struggle for life every
light variation has been favorable to the animal&mdash;has facilitated
its escape from the hunter and its preying upon the living things upon
which it subsists. Those with darker coverings have gradually become
extinct, leaving in undisputed possession of the snow banks and
icebergs this species, which in color resembles the general aspect of
its surroundings. Look at the rabbits. Some change their color every
year; some are brown in the summer and white like the snow in winter.
Those with this tendency to change their color during the year, having
the most favorable variation, have persisted, and this tendency, by
heredity, has been accumulated, until it has become a part of the
nature of the animal.</p>
<p>These are but illustrations of a principle discovered by Darwin and
Wallace, which explains largely how, not only color and thickness of
coverings, but speed, strength and suppleness of body, keenness of
sight and hearing, and all other parts and powers of organism have been
developed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>adaptation to their environment, without any
special design whatever.</p>
<p>It is said we have no evidence of the eternal existence of the
universe, because we have no personal observation of it. But is there
any personal observation to prove the existence of an eternal God? Yet
it is believed in by our opponents. We believe the universe always has
existed in the past, because we see no trace of a beginning; we believe
it will always exist in the future, because we see no prospect or
possibility of an end. Worlds have their formation and dissolution; but
the substance is neither augmented nor diminished. Matter is
indestructible and eternal. We are not, therefore, in need of a
creator.</p>

ignorance a gracious boon in mercy sent? Pain and misery are not
exceptional features of man&rsquo;s life on earth, but they are chief
characteristics of it. Are some unconscious of their degradation? Shall

birds devour the smaller, and the ferocious beasts of prey live upon
the weaker and less fleet animals. In this struggle for existence there
is one perpetual battle; the smaller, weaker and less fleet are
captured and devoured by the stronger, and man destroys and eats any of
them at his pleasure.</p>
<p>Is there a display of intelligence and benevolent design in creating
man with strength and wisdom to slaughter his prey at will? Then where
is the benevolence of design in creating the animals to be thus
slaughtered?</p>
<p>The universe, we shall find, does not exhibit evidence of a

<h3 class="main">Providence.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Religious people see Providence in everything. Strange
it is, too, that the most marked displays of Providence are seen in
shipwrecks, railroad collisions, or in all devastating fires, floods,
and plagues. In such appalling calamities as lead most sensible men to
say with &AElig;neas, &ldquo;If there be gods, they certainly take no
interest in the affairs of men,&rdquo; the Christian sees proof of a
good guardian, a saving God, where nothing but destruction and ruin
mark his pathway. There is a strange fatuity manifested by believers in
this doctrine. Not long since a young man died very suddenly in Boston.
There was a post-mortem examination by regular <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>physicians, and a coroner&rsquo;s jury, who
mutually deliberated over the body as to the cause of its death. The
doctors found the young man&rsquo;s stomach somewhat irritated. On
close inspection the contents of the stomach were found to be a mixture
of bread and butter, mince pie and coffee, ham and eggs, buckwheat
cakes, oyster stew, plum pudding, pound cake, corned beef, ice cream,
more mince pie, and baked beans.</p>
<p>The jury gave the case most grave and deliberate consideration, and
in accordance therewith returned the verdict: &ldquo;Came to his death
by a mysterious dispensation of the afflictive hand of
Providence.&rdquo; Just so! Anything, however evil, unjust or foolish
may be attributed to Providence; yet he remains both wise and good.</p>
<p>Why, if this world is created and controlled by infinite wisdom and
benevolence, are not all things beautiful? One of man&rsquo;s noblest
endeavors is to beautify. But we see many flowers and plants which are
not beautiful.</p>
<p>Many parts of the earth are inhospitable and forbidding. What
beauties on the other hand lie buried at the bottom of the ocean, its
flora, shells, and corals! But no human eye ever sees them. Wherein is
the evidence of design? Where is the evidence of design in the horrid
monsters which once filled the oceans? Where is the design in creating
such monstrosities as we see among animals?</p>
<p>Did the designer intend that parasites should infest the human body?
The creator made the parasites (lice) and their proper dwelling-place
seems to be the human body. The human body gives them their proper
food. They are so constituted as to reproduce themselves rapidly and
thus persist in feeding upon man.</p>
<p>The question is immediately raised: &ldquo;Were the lice made for
man, or man for the lice?&rdquo; When did it ever occur to a sane mind
that bed-bugs and mosquitoes and fleas were created with a benevolent
design?</p>
<p>These facts are irreconcileable with the notion of a supreme and
beneficent Providence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>Where is the evidence of benevolent design in earthquakes, floods,
volcanoes, drouth, famine, and ten thousand ills which flesh is heir
to? Where is the moral purpose? Where is the benevolence in peopling
the earth with millions of human beings who live lives of poverty and
misery?</p>
<p>But it is argued that we cannot see it all now, but by and by it
will be made plain to us, that is, when we get into the other world.
This is begging the question. The Christian says creation shows a
creator, who first created the universe and now presides over it. But
when we bring the facts of this world, its abounding evils and human
miseries, to show the absence of any benevolent superintendence, he
promises to make good his argument in the next world. This is asking a
fellow to wait too long. Again, it is argued by the Christian that God
ordained pain to work out good; but how comes it that this ordination
of working good out of evil does not take place? Sometimes one man is
made better by it, and another is brutalized by it. How does this come
to pass if pain was ordained to work good? Has the plan of the designer
failed? &ldquo;The evils of this world are ordained for the purpose of
developing our souls; only by pain and suffering can we be prepared for
heaven.&rdquo; Little children who die, according to this dogma, can
never be developed.</p>

</div>
<p>But sparrows do fall to the ground nevertheless. And if some do not
fall to the ground that wicked bird the sparrow-hawk, devours them
sometimes before they have an opportunity to fall. It is the same wise
and kind Providence who makes the sparrow and the sparrow-hawk, but
perhaps the poor sparrow does not recognize the wisdom and mercy of
having a destroyer. But our good Christian friends will have it that
all things come to pass by the direct control of an all-wise and
all-good Providence. The Chicago fire, the Boston fire, and others are
all dispensations of Providence, if we may believe the ministers, and
they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>the only ones who pretend to have positive
information of the facts. The bursting of a mill-dam, or a tidal-wave,
or anything and everything else that carries the besom of destruction
to thousands is to them a well-known intervention of the hand of a wise
and merciful Providence. It is the same, with good fortune; if we as a
people have great prosperity, large harvests and abundance of trade, it
is because of this &ldquo;All-wise Providence.&rdquo; He brings the
evil and the good, miseries and joys, sins and salvation.</p>
<p>How do we know there is a kind Providence watching over this world?
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says our Christian friend, &ldquo;we see this
manifested in the kindly adaptations of nature to man&rsquo;s
conditions, everything seems to have been made for man&rsquo;s
comfort.&rdquo; But, this general adaptation of man to nature and of
nature to man, proves nothing of a conscious intelligence ruling over
the universe. The maggot in the cheese might look around him and say,
if he could talk: &ldquo;All this cheese was made for me, because
it&rsquo;s perfectly adapted to my wants and conditions.&rdquo; Man and
maggot are adapted to their surroundings, because their surroundings
have made them what they are.</p>
<p>After attempting to prove the existence of a special Providence, and
failing, the Christian then craw-fishes into absurd talk of a
<i>mysterious</i> Providence, a <i>dark dispensation</i> of Providence,
an <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e8486" title=
"Source: inscrutible">inscrutable</span></i> Providence, an
<i>inexplicable</i> Providence. And when driven from this refuge, he at
last exclaims: &ldquo;Well, if it all seems dark and hidden from our
understanding here, it will <i>all</i> be made clear when we pass over
to the other side.&rdquo; Yes, but you admit by this statement that you
know now positively nothing of a conscious intelligence ruling the
universe, why not say so?</p>
<p>The fundamental idea of a special Providence, is that he prevents
accidents; but in spite of special Providence, accidents do occur. And
even these mishaps, which show that no such thing as Providence exists,
are claimed by the superstitious as proof of a <i>mysterious</i>
Providence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=

<p class="first">Francis Bacon says: &ldquo;We shall do well to bear in
mind the ancient story of one who in Pagan times was shown a temple
with a picture of all the persons who had been saved from shipwreck,
after paying their vows. When asked whether he did acknowledge the
power of the gods, &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but where are
they painted who were drowned after their vows?&rdquo; (Jevon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Principles of Science,&rdquo; part 2, p. 5.)</p>
<p>We learn from the little care which nature takes of <i>single</i>
individuals. Thousands of them are sacrificed without hesitation or
repentance in the plenty of nature. Even with regard to man we make the
same experience. Not one half of the human race reach the second year
of their age, but die almost without having known that they ever lived.
We learn this very thing also from the misfortunes and mishaps of all
men, the good as well as the bad, which cannot well be made to agree
with the special preservation or co-operation of the creator.

<p>But with the conception of a supreme <span class="corr" id=

gratuitous infliction of misery, in common with other terrestrial
creatures capable of feeling, is also absolutely
incompatible.&mdash;Spencer.</p>
<p>In short, there can be no hypothesis of a &ldquo;moral

&ldquo;immoral government.&rdquo; (Fisk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cosmic
Philosophy,&rdquo; vol. 2, p. 407.)</p>
<p>But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to
declare that there was a time when slavery was right&mdash;when men
could buy, and women could sell, their babes. He is compelled to insist
that there was a time when Polygamy was the highest form of virtue;
when wars of extermination were waged with the sword of mercy; when
religious toleration was a crime, and when death was the just penalty
for having expressed an honest thought. He must maintain that Jehovah
is just as bad now as he was four thousand years ago, or that he was
just as good then as he is now, but that human conditions have so
changed that slavery, polygamy, religious persecutions, and wars of
conquest are now perfectly devilish. Once they were right&mdash;once
they were commanded by God himself; now, they are prohibited. There has
been such a change in the conditions of man that, at the present time,
the Devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy, religious persecution, and
wars of conquest. That is to say, the Devil entertains the same opinion
to-day that Jehovah held four thousand years <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>ago,
but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same&mdash;changeless and incapable of change.... A very curious thing
about these commandments is that their supposed author violated nearly
every one. From Sinai, according to the account, he said: &ldquo;Thou
shalt not kill,&rdquo; and yet he ordered the murder of millions;
&ldquo;Thou shalt not commit adultery,&rdquo; and yet he gave captured
maidens to gratify the lust of captors; &ldquo;Thou shalt not
steal,&rdquo; and yet he gave to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds
of others; &ldquo;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&rsquo;s house, nor
his wife,&rdquo; and yet he allowed his chosen people to destroy the
homes of neighbors and to steal their wives; &ldquo;Honor thy father
and thy mother,&rdquo; and yet this same God had thousands of fathers
butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
&ldquo;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,&rdquo;
and yet he sent abroad &ldquo;lying spirits&rdquo; to deceive his own
prophets, and in a hundred ways paid tribute to deceit. So far as we
know, Jehovah kept only one of these commandments&mdash;he worshipped
no other God. (&ldquo;Ingersoll&rsquo;s Reply to Black.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>It is said of Christ that he was infinitely kind and generous,
infinitely merciful because when on earth he cured the sick, the lame,
and the blind. Has he not as much power now as he had then? If he has
and is the God of all worlds, why does he not now give back to the
widow her son? Why does he withhold light from the blind, and why does
one who had the power miraculously to feed thousands allow millions to
die for want of food? Where is he now? (&ldquo;Ingersoll&rsquo;s

<h3 class="main">First Cause.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Assuming then, the existence of a First Cause, let us
inquire for a moment into its nature. The First Cause must be
<i>infinite</i>. For if we regard it as finite, we regard it as bounded
or limited, and are thus compelled to think of a region beyond its
limits, which region is uncaused. And if we admit this, we virtually
abandon the doctrine of causation altogether. We, therefore, have no
alternative but to regard the First Cause an infinite.</p>
<p>We are no less irresistibly compelled to regard the First Cause as
independent. For if it be dependent, that on which it depends must be
the First Cause. The First Cause can therefore have no necessary
relation to any other form of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>being; since if the presence
of any other form of existence is necessary to its completeness, it is
partially dependent upon such other form of existence, and cannot be
the First Cause. Thus the First Cause, besides being infinite, must be
complete in itself, existing independently of all relations,&mdash;that
is, it must be <i>absolute</i>.</p>
<p>To such conclusions, following the most refined metaphysical
philosophy of the day, are we easily led. By the very limitations of
our faculties, we are compelled to think of a First Cause of all
phenomena; and we are compelled to think of it as both infinite and
absolute.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it will not be difficult to show that such a
conclusion is utterly illusive; and that in joining together, the three
conceptions of Cause, of Infinite, and of Absolute, we have woven for
ourselves a net-work of contradictions, more formidable, more
disheartening than any that we have yet been required to contemplate.
For, in the first place, that which is a cause cannot at the same time
be absolute. For the definition of the Absolute is that which exists
out of all relations; whereas a cause not only sustains some definite
relation to its effect, but it exists as a cause only by virtue of such
relation. Suppress the effect, and the cause has ceased to be a cause.
The phrase &ldquo;absolute cause,&rdquo; therefore, which is equivalent
to &ldquo;non-relative cause,&rdquo; is like the phrase &ldquo;circular
triangle.&rdquo; The two words stand for conceptions which cannot be
made to unite. &ldquo;We attempt,&rdquo; says Mr. Mansel, &ldquo;to
escape from this apparent contradiction by introducing the idea of
succession in time. The Absolute exists first by itself, and afterwards
becomes a cause. But here, we are checkmated by the third conception,
that of the Infinite. How can the Infinite become that which it was not
from the first? If causation is a possible mode of existence, that
which exists without causing is not infinite; that which becomes a
cause has passed beyond its former limits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing all these obstacles overcome, so that we might
frame a valid conception of a cause which is also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>absolute and infinite: have we then explained
the origin of the universe? Have we advanced one step toward explaining
how the Absolute can be the source of the Relative, or how the Infinite
can give rise to the Finite?&rdquo; To continue with Mr. Mansel,
&ldquo;if the condition of <span class="corr" id="xd21e8546" title=
"Source: causual">causal</span> activity is a higher state than that of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e8549" title=
"Source: quiesence">quiescence</span>, the Absolute ... has passed from
a condition of comparative imperfection to one of comparative
perfection; and therefore was not originally perfect. If the state of
activity is an inferior state to that of quiesence, the Absolute in
becoming a cause has lost its original perfection. There remains only
the supposition that the two states are equal, and the act of creation
one of complete indifference. But this supposition annihilates the
unity of the Absolute.&rdquo; (John Fiske, &ldquo;Cosmic

and reverend rabbins earnestly disputed among themselves, whether it
was lawful or not to eat an egg that was laid upon the Sabbath day. In
the minds of some of these grave and wise masters it was held to be a
prohibited egg, but in the stomachs of others of their number such eggs
were held as too good to be despised.</p>

matter? Simply because people do not understand the question. Millions
of devout worshippers use the terms Sunday and Sabbath as if they were
synonymous. Millions of superstitious persons cherish obligations to
maintain better conduct on Sunday than on any other day in the week.
They cannot understand that it is fit and proper to do on Sunday
anything that it is fit and proper to do on any other day. The tendency
to perform the duties of life correctly on Sunday leaves room and
disposition not to perform them so well on the other six days of the

ancient deities. As seven planets and seven metals were at that time
known&mdash;the sun, the moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn
being the planets of astrology&mdash;a due allotment was made, gold was
held sacred to the sun, silver to the moon, iron to Mars, etc. Even the
portions of time were in a like manner dedicated; the seven days of the
week were respectively given to the seven planets of astrology. The
names imposed on these days, and the order in which they occur, are
obviously connected with the Ptolemaic hypothesis of astronomy, each of
the planets having an hour assigned to it in its order of occurrence,
and the planet ruling first the hour of each day giving its name to
that day. Thus arranged, the week is a remarkable instance of the
longevity of an institution adapted to the wants of man. It has
survived through many changes of empire and has forced itself on the
ecclesiastical system of Europe, which, unable to change its idolatrous
aspect, has encouraged the vulgar error that it owes its authenticity
to the holy scriptures; an error too plainly betrayed by the Pagan
names that the days bear, and also by their order of occurrence.

<p class="first">It is remarkable that every day of the week is by
different nations devoted to the public celebration of religious
services:&mdash;Sunday by the Christians, Monday by the Greeks, Tuesday
by the Persians, Wednesday by the Assyrians, Thursday by the Egyptians,
Friday by the Turks, Saturday by the Jews.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">From a passage in Genesis, in which the first
reference to a Sabbath occurs, the inference has been drawn (an
inference not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>warranted by the text) that the first parents of
the human race were taught by God himself to divide time into weeks,
and to set apart a portion as a day of rest, and for religious
purposes. If so, it would of course follow that this institution, or
some traces of it, would be found among all nations; and the
impression, therefore, on the mind of a very large class of persons, is
a very natural one, that however much a Sabbath may have fallen into
disuse, or be now disregarded, the week of seven days has been kept by
all generations of mankind from the days of creation, and continues to
be observed in every part of the world. (&ldquo;Westminster
Review,&rdquo; October 1850, p. 134.)</p>
</div>
<p>It is, however, true that observance of one day in seven as a day of
rest, recreation, and pleasure obtains in many countries. How then did
it come about if it was not revealed to man, that we keep in a special
manner</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">One Day in Seven?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The observance of a seventh part of the week is no
more a revelation than the multiplication table is. It was natural for
man to measure the spaces of time. The revolution of the earth, or from
sun to sun was a day, and from new moon to new moon was a month of
twenty-eight days. It was a most natural thing to have feasts at the
full of the moon and at new moon; between these times were the
&ldquo;horned moon,&rdquo; and this marked another division of time. It
was easy to divide the full moon into four periods, each of seven days.
Hence originated the observance of one day in seven. After the moon
time had been divided into four parts each of seven days and the days
specifically named, then the old phraseology of &ldquo;new moon
days&rdquo; was dropped as it was no longer needed.</p>
<p>There are two different reasons given for observing the Sabbath:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the
Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2020:11">Exodus
20&nbsp;: 11</a>.)</p>
<p>And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that
the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a
stretched-out arm; <i>therefore</i> the Lord thy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>God
commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day. (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%205:15">Deuteronomy
5&nbsp;: 15</a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>Here are two distinct and contradictory accounts given of the origin
of the Sabbath. According to the first, God instituted the Sabbath on
the seventh day of time, immediately after his six days of creation.
But if we are to believe the writer of Deuteronomy the Sabbath was set
up as a memorial day of the Jews&rsquo; escape from Egyptian bondage;
an occurrence that took place something like two thousand five hundred
years after the year one, of creation. Both of these statements cannot
be correct, as one excludes the other. And in view of the fact that man
naturally learned to divide time into days, moons, and quarter moons we
are strongly inclined to think that both of these ancient accounts are
mythical.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The word <i>holy</i> has lost its original
signification. The Hebrew word <i>kadosh</i> means &ldquo;to set
apart.&rdquo; Parkhurst renders it, &ldquo;to separate, to set apart
from its common and ordinary to some higher use or purpose.&rdquo; It
is used in this sense in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%204">Genesis
4</a>&nbsp;: &ldquo;And God <i>divided</i> [i.e. separated] the light
from the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vessels of the sanctuary were to be &ldquo;Holy unto the
Lord;&rdquo; that is, they were to be kept strictly separate from other
vessels, for the sanctuary.</p>
<p>The saba or Sabbath was a day of <i>rest</i>, and the command to
keep it holy did not mean that it should be observed with solemnity, or
kept by offering sacrifices or in the performance of other religious
ceremonies. Other days were working days, but the Sabbath was to be a
day of rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word <i>holy</i>,&rdquo; says a modern writer on the
Sabbath, &ldquo;has now become so associated in our minds with
Puritanical ideas of self-mortification and with modern religious forms
of worship, that we are naturally misled by it from the meaning of the
original. Many pious persons suppose that the command to keep the
Sabbath day <i>holy</i> was equivalent to an injunction to attend a
parish church, hear two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href=
"#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>or more sermons in the course of
the Sunday and during the rest of the day to keep in-doors and read the
Bible. The Jews, however, did not do this, for the Bible was not
written, and sermons in its exposition (which would have wanted texts)
could not well be preached. Nor does it appear from any passage in the
books of Moses, that religious admonitions or discourses of any kind
formed a part of the tabernacle service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jewish Sabbath was emphatically a day of rest. Work, therefore,
was strictly prohibited; for &ldquo;Whosoever doeth any work in the
Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2031:15">Exodus
31&nbsp;: 15</a>.)</p>
<p>This law was not so literal as subsequent interpreters have made it.
We have an account of only <i>one</i> person being put to death for
this crime. It is recorded in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2015:32-36">Numbers,
15&nbsp;: 32&ndash;36</a> that &ldquo;while the children of Israel were
in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the
Sabbath day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">And they that found him gathering sticks brought him
unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</p>
<p>And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be
done to him.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death;
all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</p>
<p>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned
him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
</div>
<p>This was the only case in all the Hebrew writings, of stoning a man
for gathering sticks on the Sabbath. But this single instance has
engendered an infinite amount of bitter persecution in the hearts of
the over-righteous, who keep the Sabbath holy and try also to make
their neighbors observe it in a like manner.</p>
<p>Sir Humphrey Davy relates in his &ldquo;Salmonia,&rdquo; page 1,345,
that he &ldquo;was walking on Arthur&rsquo;s Seat with some of the most
distinguished professors of Edinburgh attached to the geological
opinions of the late Dr. Hutton, a discussion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>took
place upon the phenomena presented by the rocks under our feet, and to
exemplify a principle, Professor Playfair broke some stones, in which I
assisted the venerable and amiable philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had hardly examined the fragments, when a man from the
crowd, who had been assisting at field-preaching, came up and warned us
off, saying, &lsquo;Ye think ye are only stane-breakers; but I ken ye
are Sabbath breakers, and ye deserve to be staned with your ain
stanes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accidents which take place on Sunday are looked upon by some people
as &ldquo;Judgments of God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">In Scotland on January 16th, 1603 the citizens were
dreadfully alarmed by an earthquake, on account of which a day of
fasting and humiliation was appointed by the magistrates and clergy.
The particular sin for which this scourge was thought to be sent, was
the custom of salmon-fishing on Sunday.</p>
<p>But this rigid feature of the Jewish Sabbath was of a negative
character, as the day was observed as a day of feasting and joy&mdash;a
day something like our Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>A variety of minor regulations referring to bodily indulgences on
that day, abundantly prove, if further proof were needed, its
recognized character as a &ldquo;feast-day&rdquo; in the natural and
general sense of the term, in Judaism. It was to be honored by the
wearing of finer garments, by three special meals of the best cheer the
house could afford; and it was considered a particularly meritorious
thing on the part of the master of the house to busy himself personally
as much as possible with the furnishing of the viands, nay, the
fetching of the very wood for the cooking, so as to do as much honor to
the &ldquo;bride-sabbath&rdquo; as in him lay.</p>
<p>Fasting, mourning, mortification of all and every kind, even special
supplicatory prayers are strictly prohibited. (Chamber&rsquo;s
Encyclopedia.)</p>
</div>
<p>If Sunday takes the place of the Sabbath, then the New Testament
would clearly reveal the fact; but it does nothing of the kind. If the
new religion was designed to take the place of the old, then we should
expect to find Jesus plainly teaching that after his death Sunday
should be observed in place of and as the Sabbath. But far from this,
we find him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>repudiating the Jewish Sabbath, and saying
nothing at all about a new day of ceremonies and worship.</p>
<p>We give a number of instances where Jesus intentionally repudiates
and violates the common usages respecting the Sabbath:</p>

<p>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and

<p>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath
day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, reader, that there is not so much as a dot in the New
Testament in favor of substituting Saturday for the Jewish Sabbath, or
for observing it as a Sabbath day. Jesus and Paul both repudiate it.
The <i>history</i> of the <i>church</i> is <i>against</i> the use of
Sunday as the Sabbath.</p>
<p>St. Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, in the year 345, says: &ldquo;Turn
thou not out of the way into Samaritanism or Judaism, for Jesus Christ
hath redeemed thee; henceforth reject all observance of Sabbaths, and
call not meats, which are really matters of indifference, common or
unclean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Jerome, in the year 392, says: &ldquo;On the Lord&rsquo;s day
they went to church, and returning from church they would apply
themselves to their allotted works and make garments for themselves and
others. The day is not a day of fasting, but a day of joy; the church
has always considered it a day of joy, and none but heretics have
thought otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir William Danville, in his &ldquo;Six Texts,&rdquo; p. 241, says:
&ldquo;Centuries of the Christian era passed away before the Sunday was
observed by the Christian church as a Sabbath. History does not furnish
us with a single proof or indication that it was at any time so
observed previous to the sabbatical edict of Constantine in A. D.
321.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Edict of Constantine.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the code of Justinian lib. 3, title 12, sec. 2 and
3, we find the first legal edict regulating the Sabbath:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation
of all trades, rest on the venerable day of the sun; but let those who
are situated in the country, freely and at full liberty attend to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>business of agriculture, because it often
happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines;
lest the critical moment being let slip, men should lose the
commodities granted by Heaven.</p>
</div>
<p>By a multitude of religious teachers of the present day, this decree
of Constantine is recognized as the foundation of all
&ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s day&rdquo; legislation; as
the first recognition by the &ldquo;body politic&rdquo; of the usages
or institutions of Christianity. But nothing can be more easily shown
than that this decree was not made in the interest of Christianity;
that it did not respect the Sabbath or Lord&rsquo;s day; and that it
was not issued by a Christian ruler.</p>
<p>The reader will notice that the decree was partial; that it related
only to certain classes, leaving other classes to still pursue their
usual avocations; and that it was respecting &ldquo;the venerable day
of the sun.&rdquo; Now we appeal with confidence to every student and
reader of the Bible, that in all the scriptures there is no such a day
or institution known as &ldquo;the venerable day of the sun.&rdquo; And
we affirm that, in this decree, Constantine not only did not
<i>mention</i> any Christian institution, but he had no
<i>reference</i> to any Christian institution.</p>
<p>On this point let such a reputable writer as Dr. Schaff testify:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">He enjoined the civil observance of Sunday, though not
as <i>dies Domini</i> [Lord&rsquo;s day], but as <i>dies solis</i> [day
of the sun], in <i>conformity</i> to his worship of <i>Apollo</i>, and
in company with an ordinance for the regular consulting of the
<i>haruspex</i> (321). (&ldquo;History of the Christian Church,&rdquo;
vol. 2.)</p>
</div>
<p>The edict of the sun&rsquo;s day was issued March 7; that for
consulting the haruspex was issued the day following, March 8. This
edict of March 8 concerned the inspection of the entrails of beasts as
a means of foretelling future events. It was a heathen practice, and
the decree was a heathen edict, made by a heathen ruler. This of itself
is sufficient to show in what light we must regard his edict for
honoring &ldquo;the venerable day of the sun.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dr. Schaff says that Constantine issued his sun&rsquo;s day decree
&ldquo;in conformity to his worship of Apollo.&rdquo; Who was Apollo,
and what relation did his worship bear to reverencing &ldquo;the day of
the sun?&rdquo; Webster says: &ldquo;A deity among the Greeks and
Romans, and worshiped under the name of <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i>, the
sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noted Men who have Rejected the Observance of Sunday as the
Sabbath.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">For if there was no need of circumcision before
Abraham, or of the observance of Sabbaths, feasts, and sacrifices,
before Moses, no more need is there of them now, after that, according
to the will of God, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has been born without
sin.&mdash;Justin Martyr.</p>
<p>They (the patriarchs) did not therefore regard circumcision nor
observe the Sabbath, neither do we; neither do we abstain from certain
foods, nor regard other injunctions which Moses subsequently delivered
to be observed in types and symbols, because such things as these do
not belong to Christians.&mdash;Eusebius.</p>
<p>As regards the Sabbath or Sunday, there is no necessity for keeping
it; but if we do, it ought not to be on account of Moses&rsquo;s
commandment, but because nature teaches us from time to time to take a
day of rest.... If anywhere the day is made holy for the mere
day&rsquo;s sake, then I order you to work on it, to dance on it, to do
anything that will reprove this encroachment on Christian spirit and
liberty.&mdash;Martin Luther.</p>
<p>The law of the Sabbath being thus repealed, that no particular day
of worship has been appointed in its place is
evident.&mdash;Milton.</p>
<p>They who think that by the authority of the church, the observance
of the Lord&rsquo;s day was appointed instead of the Sabbath, as if
necessary, are greatly deceived.&mdash;Melancthon.</p>
<p>And truly we see what such a doctrine has profited; for those who
adopt it far exceed the Jews in a gross, carnal, and superstitious
observance of the Sabbath.&mdash;John Calvin.</p>
<p>These things refute those who suppose that the first day of the week
(that is, the Lord&rsquo;s day) was substituted in place of the
Sabbath, for no mention is made of such a thing by Christ or his
Apostles.&mdash;Grotius. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>It will be plainly seen that Jesus did decidedly and avowedly
<i>violate</i> the Sabbath. The dogma of the assembly of divines at
Westminster, that the observance of the Sabbath is a part of the moral
law, is to me utterly unintelligible.&mdash;Archbishop Whately.</p>
<p>As for the Sabbath, we be lords over the Sabbath, and may yet change
it into Monday, or into any other day as we see need, or make every
tenth day a holy day only, if we see cause why. We may make two every
week, if it were expedient, and not one enough to teach the people.
Neither was there any cause to change it from Saturday than to put
difference between us and the Jews, and lest we should become servants
unto the day, after their superstition. Neither need we any holy day at
all if the people might be taught without it.&mdash;William
Tyndall.</p>
<p>The effect of which consideration is, that the Lord&rsquo;s day did
not succeed in the place of the Sabbath, but the Sabbath was wholly
abrogated, and the Lord&rsquo;s day was merely an ecclesiastical
institution.&mdash;Jeremy Taylor.</p>
<p>The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always a human
ordinance, and it was far from the intention of the Apostles to
establish a divine command in this respect; far from them and the early
Apostolic church to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps
at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had
begun to take place, for men appear by that time to have considered
laboring on Sunday as a sin.&mdash;Neander.</p>
<p>Dr. McNight says: The whole law of Moses being abrogated by Christ,
Christians are under no obligation to observe any of the Jewish
holidays&mdash;not even the Sabbath. (Com. on Epistles, Col.)</p>

<h3 class="main">Sabbath Engenders Cruelty.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The history of the Sabbatarians proves them to be both
ignorant and cruel. We have only to make a few quotations from standard
authors to prove the charge.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">At the same time that James shocked in so violent a
manner, the religious principles of his Scottish subjects, he acted in
opposition to those of his English. He had observed, in his progress
through England, that a Judaical observance of the Sunday, chiefly by
means of the Puritans, was every day gaining ground throughout the
kingdom; and that the people under color of religion, were contrary to
former practice, debarred such sports and recreations as contributed
both to their health and amusement. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>Festivals which in
other nations and ages are partly dedicated to public worship, partly
to mirth and society, were here totally appropriated to the offices of
religion and served to nourish those sullen and gloomy contemplations,
to which the people were of themselves so unfortunately subject. The
king imagined that it would be easy to infuse cheerfulness into the
dark spirit of devotion. He issued a proclamation to allow and
encourage, after divine service, all kinds of lawful games and
exercises; and by his authority he endeavored to give sanction to a
practice which his subjects regarded as the utmost instance of
profaneness and impiety. (&ldquo;Hume&rsquo;s History of
England,&rdquo; vol. 4, p. 447.)</p>
</div>
<p>Hume, speaking of the Puritans, remarks:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">They [the house of commons] also enacted laws for the
strict observance of Sunday which the Puritans affected to call the
Sabbath, and which, they sanctified by most melancholy indolence. (Vol.
5, p. 10.)</p>
<p>Besides this, it is important to remark that the Puritans were more
fanatical than superstitious. They were so ignorant of the real
principles of government, as to direct penal laws against private
vices. (&ldquo;Buckle&rsquo;s History of Civilization in
England,&rdquo; vol. 1, p. 261.)</p>
</div>
<p>The same spirit is rampant now in our prohibition laws, Sunday laws,
profane swearing laws, etc. Repressing vices does not extinguish them
but causes them to become more deep-seated and wide-spread. Moral
natures can be made more moral only by the use of moral means.</p>

<p class="first">Not dancers go to heaven, but mourners; not laughers
but weepers; whose tune is Lachrymae, whose music sighs for sin; who
know no other cinquepace but this to heaven, to go mourning all the day
long for their iniquities; to mourn in secret like doves, to chatter
like cranes for their own and others&rsquo; sins. Fastings, prayers,
mourning, tears, tribulations, martyrdom were the only sounds that led
all the saints to heaven. (&ldquo;Bayne&rsquo;s Chief Actors in the
Puritan Revolution,&rdquo; p. 112.)</p>

<p class="first">Presbyterianism in Scotland was the twin of English
Puritanism; Presbyterianism prohibited all sorts of pleasure as being
sinful and of the Devil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=

<p>The following extracts are copied from Buckle&rsquo;s History of
Civilization in England, volume 2, page 304:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Smiling, provided it stopped short of laughter, might
occasionally be allowed; still, being a carnal pastime it was a sin to
smile on Sunday. It was wrong to take pleasure in beautiful scenery;
for a pious man had no concern with such matters which were beneath
him, and which should be left to the unconverted.</p>
<p>The unregenerate might delight in these vanities, but they who were
properly instructed saw nature as she really was, and knew that she,
for about five thousand years, had been constantly on the move, her
vigor was well nigh spent, and her pristine energy had departed. To the
eye of ignorance she still seemed fair and fresh; the fact, however,
was that she was worn out and decrepit; she was suffering from extreme
old age; her frame no longer elastic, was leaning on one side, and she
soon would perish.</p>
<p>Owing to the sin of man all things were getting worse, and nature
was degenerating so fast that already the lilies were losing their
whiteness and the roses their smell.</p>
<p>On this account, it was improper to care for beauty of any kind; or
to speak more accurately, there was no real beauty. The world afforded
nothing worth looking at save and except the Scotch Kirk, which was
incomparably the most beautiful thing under heaven. To look at that was
a lawful enjoyment but every other pleasure was sinful. To write
poetry, for instance, was a grievous offense, and worthy of special
condemnation. To listen to music was equally wrong; for men had no
right to disport themselves in such idle recreation. Hence the clergy
forbade music to be introduced even during the festivities of a
marriage.</p>
<p>Dancing was so extremely sinful that an edict expressly prohibiting
it was enacted by the General Assembly, and read in every church in
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>It was a sin for any Scotch town to hold a market either on Saturday
or Monday, because both days were near Sunday. It was a sin to go from
one town to another on Sunday, however pressing the business might be.
It was a sin to visit your friend on Sunday; it was likewise sinful
either to have your garden watered or your beard shaved.</p>
<p>No one, on Sunday, should pay attention to his health or think of
his body at all. On that day horse exercise was sinful; so was walking
in the fields or in the meadows, or in the streets, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>enjoying the fine weather by sitting at the door
of your own house. To go to sleep on Sunday before the duties of the
day were over was also sinful and deserved church censure. Bathing,
being pleasant as well as wholesome, was a particularly grievous
offense; and no man could be allowed to swim on Sunday.</p>
<p>It mattered not what man liked; the mere fact of his liking it made
it sinful. Whatever was natural was wrong. The clergy deprived the
people of their holidays, their amusements, their shows, their games,
and their sports; they repressed every appearance of joy, they forbade
all merriment, they stopped all festivities, they choked up every
avenue by which pleasure could enter, and spread over the country an
universal gloom.</p>
<p>On Sunday, in particular, he must never think of benefitting others;
and the Scotch clergy did not hesitate to teach the people that on that
day it was sinful to serve a vessel in distress, and that it was a
proof of religion to let ship and crew perish. They might go; none but
their wives and children would suffer, and that was nothing in
comparison with breaking the Sabbath. So, too, did the clergy teach,
that on no occasion must food or shelter be given to a starving man,
unless his opinions were orthodox.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sunday Should be Regarded as a day of Rest and
Recreation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But every one should be protected in his individual
liberty of choosing how he shall rest and enjoy himself. My neighbors
certainly have no right to say how I shall conduct myself on Sunday,
nor would they have if they were elected to the state or national
legislature. My right to freedom of conscience is inalienable. It is
true that I may be robbed of my liberty by those in power. The Sunday
laws are the <span class="corr" id="xd21e8996" title=
"Source: spoilation">spoliation</span> of the weak by the strong. A
most remarkable trait of this nation is that it is constituted more
than any other people that the sun ever shone upon of law <i>makers</i>
and law <i>breakers</i>. It forebodes national decay. The people who
indulge in this spirit are lacking in moral sentiment, and the current
history of the politics and religion of this country furnish a
lamentable proof of the fact.</p>

<h3 class="main">Unconstitutionality of Sunday Laws.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no provision in the constitution requiring
the citizens of the United States to observe Sunday in a religious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>manner; but there are on the contrary, distinct
and unqualified guarantees made to secure the religious liberty of
every one. Sunday is a day of rest in the eyes of the Constitution but
not a day of religious worship. Constitutionally it is every
one&rsquo;s privilege to spend Sunday as he chooses. He may, if he
wishes, go to Sunday-school, class-meeting, preaching, prayer-meeting,
and preaching again, and thus employ all his time on Sunday in
religious exercises; or if he prefers, he need go only once to service
and fall asleep as soon as it begins. Others who desire it may visit
the parks, green fields, ride upon the cool waters or visit the
libraries, museums, picture galleries, zoological gardens and such
other places of amusement and instruction as they see fit. It is the
right of every American citizen to decide in what way he should pursue
his own happiness.</p>
<p>We read in Article 6 of the Constitution, that &ldquo;no
<i>religious</i> test shall be required as a qualification to any
office or public trust under the United States.&rdquo; This foundation
principle was supplemented by a provision in the first amendment, which
says: &ldquo;Congress shall make <i>no</i> laws respecting an
establishment of <i>religion</i> or prohibiting the <i>free</i>
exercise thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could be clearer than this, that the framers of the
Constitution intended to exclude all religious questions from the
charter of liberty? The Constitution recognizes the beliefs of neither
Jew nor Gentile&mdash;neither Christian nor Infidel.</p>
<p>The one special object of the framers of the Constitution was to
establish a free government, and especially did they aim to secure to
the people their individual rights, and no right was so greatly in
demand by the people as the right of a free conscience; the right to
exercise their own judgment upon questions of religion.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We, the people of the United Slates, in order
to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general
welfare and <i>secure</i> the <i>blessings of liberty</i> to
<i>ourselves</i> and our <i>posterity</i>, do ordain and establish this
Constitution of the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence shows us that this question of
<i>liberty</i> was that which the framers of the Constitution were
seeking to establish: &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator
with certain <i>inalienable</i> rights; that among these are life,
liberty and the <i>pursuit</i> of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words of the Declaration of Independence before us and
the provision in Article 6 of the Constitution, namely, thus, &ldquo;no
<i>religious test</i> shall ever be required as a qualification to any
public trust under the United States,&rdquo; and the further guarantee
in the first amendment, that &ldquo;congress shall make <i>no</i> law
respecting an establishment of <i>religion</i> or prohibiting the
<i>free</i> exercise thereof;&rdquo;&mdash;it is as clear as a sunbeam
that all laws seeking to enforce a religious observance of Sunday are
unconstitutional, and should not be executed; and where attempts are
made to bind religious observance of the day upon Liberal people they
should resist it as an intolerable despotism.</p>
<p>The different states of the Union have numerous Sunday laws, which
in most cases are a dead letter. Take for instance Massachusetts. In
its history seventy-five cases have been decided mostly in favor of a
rigid enforcement of its Sunday laws. But both laws and decisions are
powerless in controlling the people to observe Sunday as Sabbath.</p>
<p>The present laws of Massachusetts prohibit games, sports, concerts,
plays, work, travel, idling, fishing, hunting, buying and selling, but
no one feels bound to obey them. Occasionally some new society springs
up calling itself &ldquo;The Society of Law and Order,&rdquo; and goes
to work to set the world right. The first thing to be done is to
enforce the Sunday laws, preventing barbers from shaving, milkmen from
distributing milk, newsdealers from selling papers, flower girls from
selling flowers, cigar stores from selling cigars, croquet players from
enjoying on their own premises an hour&rsquo;s exercise and amusement,
steamboats from carrying excursions from the city, ball players from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>practicing their games, the angler from taking a
few trout, and many others from finding rest and recreation in other
ways. But these good people who think that the world is out of joint
and they are called to set it right, find it a greater task than they
had bargained for, and so they soon tire, and the old world wags along
as it did before the &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; society came into
existence.</p>
<p>Sunday laws are a solemn farce, and a burning shame. They are a
warfare upon the rights of man, in the interest of ancient traditions
and modern despotism.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">As for travel on the Lord&rsquo;s day, lo! how the
people go their journeys, take their pleasure rides, rattle over the
streets with their horse-cars, thunder through the villages past
churches with their locomotives, and plow the bogs and coastways with
their yachts and excursion steamers. Who questions the right? In the
line of sport and diversion, how common such things as boating and
fishing and hunting and ball playing and roving over pastures, through
woods, picking berries and gathering nuts, and attending many a public
entertainment to which an admittance fee is charged and taken for
purposes of gain, but whose character, however sacred in name, is as
secular as a banjo concert or a play of the drama. No complaint. As
regards traffic, do not livery stable keepers let their horses as
freely on Sundays as on week days? Do not druggists sell as freely what
they possess, whether cigars or whisky, hairbrushes or perfumery? Do
not hotels ply their business as freely, always at the tobacco stand
and often at the bar? Do not newsboys run as loose with their shouts of
&ldquo;Herald and Gazette?&rdquo; While if you sail down of a
Lord&rsquo;s day to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, where &ldquo;religion is
the chief concern,&rdquo; shall you not see cigar stores, fruit stores,
toy stores, souvenir stores, etc., undisguisedly open for business, and
pedlars hawking canes and gim-cracks unchallenged by any deacon or
dignitary? When, therefore, the legislature (of Massachusetts) enacted
as late as 1863 that whoever does any manner of work or business on the
Lord&rsquo;s day shall be punished by a fine not exceeding fifty
dollars, instead of a fine not exceeding ten dollars, the former
penalty, it would seem that the intention must have been to provide a
penalty commensurate with the gravest breaches of the statute. What are
these, if they be not the running of passenger and freight railway
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>trains, whose mercenary noise makes havoc of all
Sunday calm and quiet; the repairing of railway tracks and bridges, the
gangs of workmen oft so large and belligerent enough to take a city;
the repairing of machinery in shops and mills; the racket of the press
turning out Sunday editions of newspapers secular as politics and
earthly as a quack medicine advertisement? These truly are open and
most gross violations of the law, but against them what murmur has been
heard taking the form of prosecution? Nay, the breaches of the law that
are prosecuted and have been are for the most part the petty breaches,
while the more flagrant offenders, as a rule, have offended with
impunity and still so offend.</p>
<p>Considering, therefore, the sturdiness with which the people of the
commonwealth resist the law&rsquo;s repeal, and the indifference with
which they treat its violations, it must be confessed that Artemus
Ward&rsquo;s sarcasm, as applied to &ldquo;prohibition,&rdquo; applies
here with peculiar force&mdash;in <i>favor</i> of the <i>law</i>, but
<i>against</i> its <i>enforcement</i>. (&ldquo;The Sunday Law of
Massachusetts,&rdquo; by a member of the Massachusetts bar, p. 29.)</p>
</div>
<p>Puck, in its history of the United States, says: &ldquo;The Puritans
instituted many beautiful customs, and they had some very remarkable
laws. They provided strict penalties against Sabbath breaking. On
Sunday, they decreed that every able-bodied man, woman, and child in
the country should go to church three times a day. They forbade reading
anything except the Bible, forbade walking in the fields, and generally
shut down on amusements. Then they called it the Lord&rsquo;s day, and
thus strove to make the Lord unpopular.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Ben. Franklin on Connecticut Sundays.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following is an extract from a letter written by
Dr. Franklin to Jared Ingersoll of New Haven. The original is in the
possession of the New Haven Colony Historical Society:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first dateline"><span class="sc">Philadelphia</span>, Dec.
11, 1762.</p>
<p>I should be glad to know what it is that distinguishes Connecticut
Religion from common Religion:&mdash;communicate, if you please, some
of these particulars that you think will amuse me as a virtuoso. When I
travelled in Flanders I thought of your <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>excessively strict
observation of Sunday; and that a man could hardly travel on that day
among you upon this lawful occasion, without Hazard of Punishment,
while where I was every one travelled, if he pleased, or diverted
himself in any other way; and in the afternoon both high and low went
to the Play or to the Opera, where there was plenty of Singing,
Fiddling and Dancing. I looked round for God&rsquo;s Judgments, but saw
no signs of them. The Cities were well built and full of Inhabitants,
the Markets filled with plenty, the People well favored and well
clothed; the Fields well tilled; the Cattle fat and strong; the Fences,
Houses and Windows all in Repair; and no <i>Old Tenor</i> anywhere in
the Country:&mdash;which would almost make one suspect that the Deity
is not so angry at that offence as a New England Justice.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">B. Franklin.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If you have any inalienable rights your freedom of conscience must
be one of the most fundamental. That is, it is for you to say how you
will deport yourself on matters of religion. It is nothing less than
despotism for your neighbor to step up to you and say: &ldquo;Brother
Jones, I want to see you at church to-day, and if you are not there I
will see to it that there is a law passed which will make you attend
church.&rdquo; This is what the Puritans actually did. They did it all
for the glory of God, but our modern Puritans, the orthodox, seek to
stop milk wagons from delivering milk on Sunday morning, flower girls
from selling flowers on the streets of New York, all because of the
welfare and purity of society. In several cities in Texas the sale of
cigars on Sunday is a violation of the law.</p>
<p>But where do these members of the state and national legislatures
get their power from? Do they have any except that which is delegated
to them by the people? They do not get the power from the people to
usurp their inalienable rights. But here is a legislature passing laws
upon the religious observance of Sunday, who have never been instructed
to secure the enactment of such laws. And even if ninety-nine out of a
hundred should so instruct their representative, the law could not be
binding upon the one hundredth person who did not so instruct his
(mis)representative in congress. He can be made to obey by their brute
force. And this is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275</a>]</span>what legislation amounts to generally. The
people are not represented by the law makers, but their interests and
rights are invaded one after another until the poor people are
subjugated. Among the rights of man perhaps there is none which is more
generally recognized abstractly, and more frequently violated
practically, than his right to freedom of conscience, or, in other
words, his religious liberty. How does this come about? One of the
principal reasons for this <span class="corr" id="xd21e9130" title=
"Source: anomally">anomaly</span> is that most people think that we
ought to obey without question the will of the majority. They seem to
think that an enactment by congress settles the question, whatever it
may be.</p>
<p>Here is the secret of the Sunday legislation. The church is a
spiritual despotism always seeking to materialize. It is in the nature
of power of all kinds to seek for more power. As a spiritual despotism
the church is not a success. The nineteenth century has said to this
mental and moral Lazarus, &ldquo;Take up thy bed and walk.&rdquo; But
it has no place to walk to, and hence it refuses to obey the voice of
humanity. It is slowly, however, undergoing the transformation of a
dissolving view.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">A Common Sense View of the Sunday Question.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Jesus said that the Sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the Sabbath. Now, at first sight, this seems a true and wise
saying, but upon reflection we are forced to modify our estimate of it.
In the first place there is no evidence that the Sabbath was ever
<i>made</i> at all. It is the result of many things. The causes
assigned for the institution of this day are conflicting. One reason
assigned is because the Lord rested on the seventh day and was
refreshed. It is a very empty noddle that can believe that statement.
Such a childish view of creation would remind us of some one who had
carried a heavy load up six flights of stairs, and then sat down
puffing and blowing until he was <i>rested</i> and <i>refreshed</i>.
Fancy an omnipotent being tired, hungry, and sleepy. A common sense
view of the creation story leads us to reject it all as a myth.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another reason assigned for the origin of the Sabbath is that it was
instituted in commemoration of God&rsquo;s deliverance of the Hebrews
out of Egypt. But this is a flat contradiction of the previous reason
given for observing the Sabbath. This contradiction is enough to
invalidate the evidence of both these testimonies; but that is not
all&mdash;the first story about God Almighty being tired after a
week&rsquo;s hard work, and his <i>resting</i> and being
<i>refreshed</i> on the seventh day, is so evidently a myth as to need
no argument. It is on a par with all stories about the man in the moon,
and the bit of legend recounting the escape of the Hebrews from Egypt
is full of contradictions and impossibilities which renders the story
absolutely useless as a piece of evidence.</p>
<p>No one knows when or where the observance of the seventh day as a
day of rest and recreation began. It doubtless had small beginnings in
different countries and different times, and has been subject to the
law of evolution. The Sabbath was not a <i>man</i>-made product, but
grew in character and importance as time rolled on. Therefore it is not
true to say the Sabbath was <i>made for man</i>. All the making we see
in history is what the priests have done in this direction. While it is
not true that the priests originated the Sabbath, yet it is true so far
as we can trace the existence of the priesthood that we find them
continually making the day a day for themselves. Sunday is
priests&rsquo; day. Everybody must go to church to listen to an
ignorant man talk, scold, misrepresent, and abuse everyone who does not
believe as he does. And this is called <i>Divine Service</i>. When the
priest rests temporarily from his labors upon the sinner and the
skeptic, he trains his guns upon some of those who profess as strongly
as himself to be true blue Christians. Take the extremes; the Salvation
Army saint and a fashionable member of the fashionable Episcopal
church. The latter looks down upon the former and calls them
&ldquo;trash, rubbish,&rdquo; and other classical names, while the
soldier of the temporal army returns the compliment by styling his
brethren <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>of the Episcopal persuasion as &ldquo;the
Devil&rsquo;s dudes.&rdquo; Behold! how these Christians love&mdash;to
go for one another.</p>
<p>We have seen that there is no history for the institution of the
Sabbath. We have learned also that to keep this day holy did not mean
to attend preaching or prayer-meetings, or special religious services
of any kind.</p>
<p>We have discovered that the Jewish Sabbath was not incorporated into
the early Christian church. We have seen also that Jesus repudiated the
Jewish Sabbath. That Paul, the founder of the church, also rejects the
Sabbath; and that the early fathers did not observe it. That the great
men of the middle ages repudiated it. It was left for the Puritans and
Scotch Presbyterians to bewilder the undeveloped mind and poison the
susceptible hearts of the people, by teaching the gloomy doctrines of
Puritanism and Presbyterianism. Puritanism and Presbyterianism die
hard. They still live. Their spirit is hostile to freedom. Talk to them
of liberty and you will readily wake the remark, &ldquo;Oh yes, we
believe in liberty, but not in <i>license</i>.&rdquo; Now what does
license mean with such people? Why it means that you shall conform to
their religious notions and practices.</p>
<p>Especially must you remember the Sabbath to keep it holy; that is,
you are at liberty to do just as you please, if you please to do as
pleases them.</p>
<p>Protestants all agree upon the right of free conscience, the right
to believe as one chooses (which however he never can do, because he
must believe according to evidence).</p>
<p>It is the great boast of Protestantism that the individual has a
free will (another error), and that he must search the scriptures, and
decide for himself. They say every man has an open Bible put before
him, and he must make up his own mind on the &ldquo;truth of
God.&rdquo; When he has made up his mind, and seeks to enter a church
which is full of liberty, what do the officers of the church say to
him? Do they tell him that his conscience is free and the Bible is an
open book for him to read and interpret as he can? Oh, no! There is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>no free conscience, or open Bible business when
one is getting into a church. On such occasions the candidate is taken
by the proper officers into an ante room, and placed upon a Procrustean
bed usually called a creed, and if he is the proper length, all right,
but if not he must either be stretched or sawed off to the proper
dimensions. And these are the people who have such a holy horror of
<i>license</i>.</p>
<p>A friend of mine went once to buy a pup. The price was five dollars;
but as there were three pups in the basket my friend said he would give
five dollars for one if he could have his choice. &ldquo;Oh yes, you
can have your choice,&rdquo; said the owner, &ldquo;if ye&rsquo;ll
choose this pup&rdquo; [pointing to the most inferior one in the
basket]. So it is with the church; you can have all the liberty in the
world to believe, if you believe the doctrines of this or that sect.
You can have your own choice, if you choose to obey the priesthood. You
can have all the liberty to think as freely as you can on all subjects,
if you will never mention your thoughts. Here is what M. Guizot, an
eminent Christian writer has to say about the liberty granted by the
church:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">When the question of political securities came into
debate between power and liberty; when any step was taken to establish
a system of permanent institutions, which might effectually protect
liberty from the invasions of power in general; the church
<i>always</i> ranged herself on the side of <i>despotism</i>.
(&ldquo;Guizot&rsquo;s History of Civilization,&rdquo; p. 130.)</p>
</div>
<p>With some people almost every act, if it be not strictly religious,
is a desecration of the Lord&rsquo;s day. It is a solemn day, and for
one to smile is a desecration of the holy day, while laughing is gross
wickedness. To entertain one&rsquo;s friends on Sunday or to enjoy
music, is carnal and therefore a desecration of the Lord&rsquo;s day.
To love flowers is evidence of depravity; to admire the beauties of
nature, as a golden sunset, or a summer&rsquo;s sunrise, are palpable
evidences of being a &ldquo;man of sin.&rdquo; To do anything but
attend church, look solemn, mourn and pray, weep and read the Bible, is
of the Devil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>What a spectacle that man presents to the world who is struggling
for perfection through religious beliefs and exercises. He never gets
exactly there, but confidently and complacently thinks himself there or
thereabouts. His next great work is to call upon others in life&rsquo;s
highway to follow in his footsteps. He gets some followers who join
with him in thanking God that they are not as other men are. Their
self-righteousness becomes intense, and they become filled with the
spirit of the Lord and preach believe (as we do) or be damned. Then
begins persecution and torture. It is always your
&ldquo;dead-in-earnest&rdquo; man that gets up persecutions. He is
trying to gain perfection, and the natural ripe fruit of religious
perfection is bigotry, intolerance, and despotism. Beware, oh! reader,
of him who is seeking perfection, for you are nothing better than a
worm under his heel, and if he does not crush you, it is because he is
better than his God. God will crush you in the next world for not
agonizing for perfection in this.</p>

<h2 class="main">WHAT IS CIVILIZATION?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Very many regard it as an <i>entity</i>, a
<i>thing</i>, rather than a <i>process</i>. It can no more be called a
thing or an entity, than life, growth, or thinking, but like these, it
is a process. &ldquo;Dr. Whately speaks of it as if it were a
&lsquo;thing&rsquo; which could be handed about from one nation to
another, or hidden away in some dark corner.&rdquo; (Fiske&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cosmic Philosophy,&rdquo; vol. 2, p. 175.) In general terms we
may define it as a progressive movement of the individual and of
society. Its results are the highest attainments, the acquisition of
the best things, as wealth, culture, and morality. But these
&ldquo;best things&rdquo; must be shared liberally by the laboring
classes or the civilization cannot long survive. Every civilization of
the past has been false in this respect. The pyramids of Egypt have a
record of kings possessing millions of slaves. Greece produced a
civilization inspired by a love of the beautiful, and has consequently
contributed more toward the civilization of mankind than any other
people. But no nation has conspicuously sought to secure to its people
the rights of liberty and justice. And until the time comes when the
people get these rights, there can be no true civilization. Humanity
must become the supreme purpose of life. The augean stables of
legislation must be renovated for the presence of better men who shall
take the places of the corrupt demagogues who now fill our highest
offices of public trust. The very fact that a dozen of our United
States senators represent $160,000,000 speaks volumes of itself.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>Many of these men have secured the most if not
all their great wealth since they have been the custodians of the
people&rsquo;s public interests.</p>
<p>A true civilization has never yet appeared in the world. Much that
is written in proof of our boasted civilization is twaddle. We are
living in many respects as barbarians lived thousands of years ago. But
to return to our definitions. It should be borne in mind that
civilization is not an end, but a means to higher ends; the results are
not therefore fixed and final, as they in turn become causes of other
results. If we regard civilization as a refined and cultured state of
society, we shall find that it means more than this&mdash;that it is
rather the activity of mind which leads to higher refinements, to
investigation, invention, discovery, and that it constantly inspires
man with desires for still nobler achievements. Civilization is the
onward and upward movement of the human race. This fermentation of
humanity is the product of many factors, and has been effected by all
sorts of human activities. War, commerce, agriculture, inventions,
crusades, discoveries, literature, art, religion, skepticism,
government, languages, science, manufactures, climate, soil, food, and
many other things have assisted in developing the mind and heart of
man, and in improving his physical condition. In the present century,
science has worked wonders by way of discovery and invention,
increasing the intellectual activities, thereby widening the knowledge
of men and augmenting the sum of human happiness.</p>
<p>We should not overlook the fact that the world&rsquo;s advancement
has been vastly more in the line of intellectual improvement and
material prosperity than in the development of man&rsquo;s moral
nature. Our civilization is much like our dress, it abounds in shoddy
and tinsel. There is much in the dome of modern civilization that
glares in the sunlight, while its foundations, which are out of sight,
are rotten. Our great cities show us that the rich are becoming richer
and the poor poorer. Where will this end? Can a splendid civilization
be established on such a basis? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>Distinguished men have entertained widely different notions of the
causes of human progress. One writer thinks that government possesses
the secret power of progress; another claims all advancement for
Christianity, and others that morality is the cause, while yet others
attribute the magic power to the forces of nature. Mr. Buckle maintains
that man&rsquo;s progress is due to his physical environment. And a
moment&rsquo;s reflection will show us that there is much truth in his
claim. We know that it is utterly impossible to establish a grand
civilization in the tropics or in the polar regions. Suppose we should
send all the ministers in the country, all the gold and silver in the
United States treasury and millions of our best citizens to Greenland,
could they build up a splendid civilization there? Not at all. Nature
is too inhospitable. Society flourishes only in a temperate climate. If
it were the church that created civilization then we should see similar
results in different latitudes and among different races. But the facts
are opposed to this claim. Wherever there is a high civilization there
is good soil and temperate climate. As an illustration of this fact I
may refer the reader to the Abyssinians, who have had the Bible in
their possession about twice as long as the Anglo-Saxons; and yet they
are all a race of barbarians still.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Christianity was introduced in that country about A.D.
330.</p>
<p>The people still remain rude and barbarous.</p>
<p>Bruce relates how he saw the people cut steaks from living cattle
and eat them raw. (Ency. Brit.)</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Buckle claims that the favorable environment produces progress
in the race, and that as man progresses he gains more control over
nature and utilizes her forces. He makes the desert to blossom, he
overcomes diseases, as plague, leprosy, and prevents famine, and
because of his increased knowledge wars are becoming less frequent and
less barbarous. From these facts he claims that the advance of
civilization is characterized by a diminishing influence of physical
laws, and an increasing influence of mental laws. In proof of his
position that climate, soil, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>and food are the determining
influences of progress, he refers us to the climate of Asia and Africa
as compared with the climate of Europe and America, pointing out the
latter as having vast mineral resources and great facilities of travel
over highways, rivers, and lakes. The temperate climate is in every way
therefore most favorable to the highest civilization.</p>
<p>In the tropics man does not have to exhaust himself in obtaining his
food, as it grows spontaneously and in abundance, but the burning sun
takes out of him his energy and enterprise; while on the other hand the
inhabitant of Greenland has to fight for life against the severe cold.
His efforts and manner of life are exhausting, and tend to dwarf him
physically, morally, and mentally. However much man may do in
overcoming nature, these two hindrances of extreme heat and excessive
cold remain insuperable barriers in his way.</p>
<p>War has been a civilizing power, although it has been fearful
expensive of blood, treasure, and public morals. The American
revolution of 1776 secured the independence of this country. The French
revolution of 1789, transformed the whole of Europe. The recent great
rebellion in this country emancipated the slave, and has made a more
perfect union of the North and South. The crusades were a great
revolutionary movement in Europe, beginning in 1096, and lasting about
two hundred years. In fact there was no such a thing as Europe before
this great epoch. The different countries which constitute Europe, had,
prior to the crusades, almost no intercourse with one another, and
consequently each was comparatively ignorant of the manners and customs
of the others. The uprising of millions of men, women, and children, as
warriors of Christ, who set out from time to time, from England,
France, Germany, and Spain to rescue the Holy Land from the Infidel,
the Mohammedan, brought wonderful experiences to the few thousand who
survived to tell their stories. The pathways over which these deluded
people thronged were whitened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>with the bleached bones of
those who had fallen victims of disease, exposure, hunger, and the
sword. What a monstrous blind sacrifice this was, offered up on the
altar of ignorance! Of course it could do the world no good to rescue
the Holy Land. If God wanted that land rescued he could do it himself.
And that he did not do so is self-evident that he did not want it
rescued, besides, he would not allow even his own peculiar people to
rescue it. The church is still offering its sacrifices of public weal,
of blood, and treasure in trying to rescue, abroad, the Pagan from his
Paganism, and at home, the Infidel from his Infidelity, while God could
do it himself if he so desired, but he does not, neither does he permit
his own &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; people to do it.</p>
<p>The crusaders had no commission from heaven for this
business&mdash;they were not the agents of God, but only
pretenders&mdash;and the church of to-day has no more right to pretend
to save the world than the crusaders had to deliver the holy sepulchre
from the so-called Pagans. The one and the others are alike impostors
upon a credulous world. The crusades did nothing in the matter of
rescuing the Holy Land. In this respect they were failures. The God of
hosts did not lead them on to certain victory. But if they did not
secure what they aimed at, they found something infinitely
better&mdash;a wider knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>The intercourse between these different peoples which was occasioned
by the marching of armies through their lands, gave new ideas to all;
broke up the feudal system, and serfdom, secured the supremacy of a
common law over the independent jurisdiction of the chiefs who claimed
the right of private wars. In a word, it was the origin of Europe, the
first great awakening of the intellect of the masses.</p>
<p>Not only were the old manners and customs changed, but there was
stimulated in society an increased mental activity; and the narrow
routine in which it had been accustomed to move was destroyed. Society
began its new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>transformations into governments and nations,
which says Guizot, is the characteristic of modern civilization.</p>

<h3 class="main">Industrial Influences.</h3>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The causes which mostly disturbed or accelerated the
normal progress of society in antiquity were the appearance of great
men. In modern times the appearance of great inventions. Printing has
secured the intellectual achievements of the past, and furnished a sure
guarantee of future progress. Gunpowder and military machinery have
rendered the triumph of barbarians impossible. Steam has united nations
in the closest bonds. Innumerable mechanical contrivances have given a
decisive preponderance to that industrial element which has colored all
the developments of our civilization. The leading characteristics of
modern societies are in consequence marked out much more by the
triumphs of inventive skill than by the sustained energy of moral
causes. (&ldquo;Lecky&rsquo;s History of European Morals,&rdquo; vol.
1, p. 126.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is not necessary to point in what way the printing
press, art, commerce, and science, have promoted the progress of the
race. It is so apparent to every intelligent reader that these have
been the stepping stones over which we have passed from barbarism to
civilization, that amplification is unnecessary.</p>
<p>The splendid results of science are everywhere so manifest that we
hardly need refer to them. What transformations the world has undergone
through the uses of the steam engine, the spinning jenny, telegraph,
ocean cable, railroads, sewing machines, photography, spectrum
analysis, and thousands of other useful inventions. We see advancement
achieved in free government, free schools, free libraries, free trade,
labor reform, prison reform, and reform in the treatment of lunatics,
paupers and criminals, and reform seeking to adjust the wrongs
perpetrated upon women.</p>
<p>Besides all these improvements there is every indication in the
spirit of to-day that we are soon to witness greater improvements, if
not radical changes in government; changes affecting capital and labor.

<h3 class="main">Skepticism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Skepticism played a prominent part in the eighteenth
century. Doubt instead of faith, possessed the minds of many of the
most distinguished men of thought, such as Voltaire, Hume, Diderot,
Rousseau, D&rsquo;Holbach, Gibbon, and others. Some of the more
prominent skeptics rejected Christianity on the common ground of
incredibility of the scriptures. But as they had no form of belief or
knowledge to substitute in place of the dogmas they rejected, it was
not difficult for the clergy with specious explanations to cover up the
doubts and disbeliefs which the skeptics raised. Something more was
needed to break the spell of superstition and arouse the minds of men
to thought and action. In the first part of the present century the
philosophy of Evolution began to find place in the minds of most
profound thinkers. Science has done what skepticism failed to
accomplish; it has given <i>knowledge</i> instead of <i>faith</i>. It
has cultivated intense intellectual habits in modern society and given
mankind a sure test of truth, in its method of verification, by means
of experiment, observation and deduction.</p>

<h3 class="main">Science.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Science is inexorably hostile to
supernaturalism&mdash;cannot recognize a particle of it. It knows
nothing of a <i>super</i>-nature; with science all is nature, and
nature is all. From pre-historic times the race has been under the
control of ignorance and superstition, the parents of fear and cruelty;
but now that science begins to dispel ignorance and superstition, we
find courage, kindness, and other humanities taking their places. And
we should say just here that Infidelity is no longer synonymous with
mere disbelief; it means more than this. It stands for all that reason
approves. Freethought is the first fruits of skepticism, and this means
honest inquiry on all subjects, old and new. It means independence and
manhood in private as well as public life&mdash;the right of everyone
to think and express his thought regardless of creeds and customs, the
right to live his own life in the enjoyment of the broadest possible
liberty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>compatible with the liberty of others.
Freethinkers are the prophets of this age, proclaiming justice as the
right of all, and predicting a day of wrath to those who trample upon
the rights of a long-suffering people. In the light of science,
priestcraft must fade away like snow under the increasing heat of the
sun.</p>

<h3 class="main">Metaphysical Method.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The church made no progress in science and art for a
thousand years. The energies of the mind had no outlet except in a few
channels which were not fruitful. The scholars of the middle ages
exerted great mental force upon empty questions, as
&ldquo;quiddities,&rdquo; &ldquo;entities,&rdquo; &ldquo;occult
virtues,&rdquo; &ldquo;efficient causes,&rdquo; &ldquo;realism and
nominalism,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;essence of things.&rdquo; Were any of
these problems ever solved? What corresponding benefit has resulted
from these long and zealous discussions? What general conclusions have
been reached? What first principles have been established by them?</p>
<p>The speculative philosophy created violent agitation in the church;
but from its very nature it offered no positive truth, no verifiable
facts to take the place of theology. The metaphysical method was
fruitless, because its supporters sought to explain every problem by
the process of thought alone.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Tennemann has fairly stated the good and bad of
scholastic philosophy. It gave rise to a great display of address,
subtlety, sagacity in the explanations and distinction of abstract
ideas, but at the same time to many trifling and minute speculations,
to a contempt of positive knowledge and too much unnecessary
refinement. (Hallam, &ldquo;Middle Ages,&rdquo; vol. 1, p. 33.)</p>
</div>
<p>For centuries the church maintained metaphysical discussions about
the nature of Christ, one party arguing that he was of the same
substance (homoousion) as the Father, and an another as strongly argued
that he was of like substance (homoiusion) as the Father. These
controversies were attended with bloody conflicts. If one party were in
possession of the revealed will of God, it was quite natural
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>that all other parties should listen to them. If
they would not they incurred the wrath of God, and if God was angry his
people ought to imitate him; if God was going to damn heretics in the
next world, his saints, who are his agents here, ought to damn them in
this.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No writer of distinction has been able, publicly, to
show that Christianity has been a powerful factor for good in the
civilization of the world. The definitions of civilization necessarily
exclude superstition. We have seen that civilization is not an
&ldquo;entity&rdquo; but a progressive movement produced by favorable
conditions, for example, temperate climate, good soil, abundance of
lakes, rivers, and mineral resources. Human activities upon a large
scale have evolved still higher and better conditions for parts of the
race. We have shown how war, commerce, agriculture, inventions,
crusades, discoveries, literature, art, skepticism, government,
languages, science, and philosophy have added to the sum of human
well-being in one way and another.</p>
<p>The revival of learning did not spring from the church, but from
Pagan literature, and Mohammedan schools. And it requires no great
research to learn that the church has never been favorably inclined
toward true learning, that is, toward science. It has insisted upon
teaching an ignorant world the unknown and unknowable. &ldquo;Carnal
reason&rdquo; and &ldquo;blasphemous science&rdquo; were never pet
lessons for its subjects. It chose rather the motto, &ldquo;Ignorance
is the mother of devotion.&rdquo;</p>

agriculture, mining, inventions, discoveries, arts, printing, morals,
liberty, and all other branches of useful learning? It contains no
instructions upon the most important and useful subjects. And of
itself, the Bible makes no claim to be an inspired revelation from God.

<h3 class="main">The Conflict between Christianity and
Civilization.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Christianity is conservative, and, like the bourbon,
never gets a new idea or forgets an old one, and it is in its very
nature, therefore, non-progressive. The advancement of humanity has
been achieved not by and through Christianity, but in conflict with and
triumph over it. Christianity itself has been subject to modification
and progress from forces without, rather than virtues within itself.
The savage doctrine &ldquo;believe or be damned,&rdquo; is no longer a
popular pulpit theme. Eternal torment has ceased to torment or terrify
the living, election and reprobation are no longer a commodity greatly
in demand, and the divine right of kings is rapidly fading out of mind.
Infant damnation is not mentioned&mdash;babes do not go to hell in
these days&mdash;they all crowd into Abraham&rsquo;s capacious bosom.
The Devil is not so black as he used to be&mdash;it was reported lately
that he is dead. Taking it all in all, there has been a great
improvement in the doctrines of the church. It should never be
forgotten, however, that it professes to save the world, while the
truth is just the opposite, that is, the world <i>saves</i> the church.
Common sense has taught the church the foolishness and wickedness of
these absurd and cruel doctrines, and has saved it from immediate decay
by forcing it to give them up. The church makes progress because it
must, not because it seeks to do so. The sanity of man is saving him
from the insanity of religion. The world moves and Christianity, though
it hangs back, must nevertheless move with it. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>progressive element is in man, and when he is
outside of the church he advances in knowledge and morality; but within
its walls he is sure to be conservative and non-progressive. For why
should he seek to make any progress? Has he not the revealed will of
God&mdash;a complete guide to duty here and to destiny hereafter?
Surely he needs no books to supersede the Bible or other virtues than
those awakened by the grace of God.</p>

cross of Christ, we shall find the same spirit, and the same bloody
deeds perpetrated upon all those who were not numbered as the peculiar
people of God. Constantine established Christianity in the Roman empire
by the sword; and his holy successors have maintained it by the same
power ever since.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although Christians now condemn polygamy, they uphold
a Bible that not only approves it, but also shows distinctly that God
instituted it.</p>
<p>Solomon had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, and
was not condemned for his polygamy or concubinage, but was condemned
for going after other Gods:</p>

<p>There is nowhere any condemnation of Solomon for his polygamy to be
found in the Bible. On the contrary, he is extolled to the highest
degree. God is represented as saying: &ldquo;I have found David, a man
after mine own heart.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>David, although he was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart, was not so
highly esteemed as Solomon who was blest with a thousand wives. David
did not have quite as many wives, and consequently did not achieve the
royal grandeur of his son Solomon. The Lord gave David a number of
wives: &ldquo;And Abigail hasted and arose, and rode upon an ass with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=

and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife. David
also took Ahinoam, of Jezreel, and they were also, both of them, his
wives. (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

David, and throws the responsibility on Jehovah. David is not censured

<p>The truth is that nearly all the patriarchs and prophets were
polygamists. They had not the faintest idea of true marriage, but took
women according to their caprice, and kept them as long as they were
pleased with them and cast them off when tired of them. It is a
remarkable fact that we do not often read of any marriage ceremony when
these men after God&rsquo;s own heart took them wives. A man in these
days who &ldquo;takes up&rdquo; with a woman without marriage is called
a free-lover. Were the patriarchs who took a number of women as wives
without a marriage ceremony free-lovers? Just now the Christians cannot
endure polygamy among the Mormons. They indorse it as a Bible
institution, good enough for Abraham, Isaac, and all the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>rest, but out of fashion just now. The worst of
it all is, the Christian sends missionaries and Bibles to the heathens
and afterward reports wonderful success in converting them from their
Paganism and polygamy through the means of preaching, praying, and
missionary work; but when he thinks of the Mormon he forgets what
wonders the missionary has done abroad in converting the polygamists,
and insists that our Congress send Winchester rifles to Utah rather
than missionaries. The Holy Ghost is of no account there. The gospel of
peace must now as ever resort to the divine efficacy of bullets rather
than Bibles, to secure a victory for truth, justice, and love.
Christianity shows the same brutal instincts of war in its treatment of
the Mormons that Constantine exhibited in establishing the church by
the sword.</p>

<p>In this case there is a lack of qualification as to whether the man
be innocent or not; and there is no allowance made in case the man who
married her who was put away should be ignorant of her being a divorced
woman.</p>
<p>Again, &ldquo;But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his
wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit

<p>Here we find not a word about the fornication of the husband. In
short, there is no equality of rights and duties taught in these
passages. Jesus, in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke teaches that
it is adultery to marry a divorced woman. No matter what the crime of
the husband has been, a wife is not allowed to put him away and marry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=

divorced from him and remarries, she commits adultery. This is only a
slight modification of the divorce law&mdash;that old law according to
which the husband had only to write his wife a bill of divorcement and
send her off; but it was not lawful for the wife to write a bill and
send the husband away. All Christian nations have repudiated the
teachings of both the Old and the New Testament on the question of
divorce.</p>
<p>Marriage is now rapidly losing its sacramental character. If matches
are made in heaven, it is evident that the work is poorly done, and for
all practical purposes they might as well be made on earth; and the
general opinion is inclined so strongly in that direction that greater
attention is now given to the laws of life, which instruct us how to
make happy earthly matches, leaving the matches of heaven to be formed
when we get there.</p>

Jacob did not <span class="corr" id="xd21e9575" title=

<p>In the purchase of wives there was usually no ceremony, more than
the witnessing of the sale. We read of David and Solomon <i>taking</i>
wives, but no mention is made of any marriage ceremony.</p>

good for man to be alone, &ldquo;caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,

<p>Neither Jesus nor Paul proclaimed the dignity of marriage, or

32</a>) he permits the husband to put away the wife for the crime of
fornication, but makes no provision for the wife to put away the
husband for the same offense. His disciples received an unfavorable
impression of marriage, and after listening to him on this subject,
they suggested: &ldquo;If the case of the man be so with his wife, it

conception of love, or of the higher and refining joys of the conjugal
relation. But permits him who cannot keep himself from beastliness to

not regard the sacrifice which the woman must make who marries the
beast. He looks upon woman as a mere safety-valve for men&rsquo;s
passions,&mdash;her rights are not considered: she has no rights. He
will permit man to marry, but young widows he denounces as heaping up
damnation to themselves in marrying: &ldquo;But the younger widows

<h4 class="main">The American Church was the Bulwark of American
Slavery.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The slave system in this country always received the
support of the church. In the early history of the country it was
occasionally condemned by some of the bravest ministers, but as the
nation grew powerful, so also did this sum of all villainies. Not only
the ministers of the slave states, but ministers of the free states
lent their support to this despotism. The Rev. N. Bangs, D.D., of New
York, said:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">It appears evident that however much the apostles
might have deprecated slavery as it then existed throughout the Roman
empire, he did not feel it his duty as an embassador of Christ, to
disturb those relations which subsisted between master and servants, by
denouncing slavery as such a <i>mortal sin</i> that they could not be
the servants of Christ in such a relation.</p>
</div>
<p>Rev. E. D. Simms, professor in Randolph-Macon college, a Methodist
institution, affirmed that, &ldquo;Those extracts from Holy writ
unequivocally assert the right of property in slaves.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Rev. Wilbur Fisk, D.D., late president of the (Methodist)
Wesleyan university, in Connecticut: &ldquo;The relation of master and
slave may and does in many cases, exist under such circumstances as
free the master from the just charge of immorality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rev. Moses Stuart, of Andover, insisted that, &ldquo;the precepts of
the New Testament respecting the demeanor of slaves and their masters,
beyond all question, recognized the existence of slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Taylor, of Yale college, said: &ldquo;I have no doubt
that if Jesus Christ was now on earth, he would, under certain
circumstances, become a slaveholder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; makes an admission. Speaking of the
degradation of the Southern negroes, it says: &ldquo;For this
Protestant Christianity solely is to blame. It allowed slavery. It was
slow to see its enormity. In the South it supported slavery with all
its power. It let the negroes live in ignorance of the word of God. It
raised no voice against unchristian laws forbidding slaves to be taught
to read, and forbidding marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could give hundreds of just such quotations from ministers who
upheld slavery as a divine institution. And these were the blind
leaders of the blind until leaders and people were precipitated into
the life and death struggle of the nation. If the preachers had been
honest and brave we would never have had to pass through the terrible
ordeal of the great rebellion.</p>
<p>The northern churches were almost all in sympathy with the
&ldquo;divine institution.&rdquo; Their ministers did not dare to
condemn the system lest they should be deposed for their abolitionism.
The writer was pastor of a Methodist church in Brooklyn in 1859, and
was dismissed from his pastorate on account of his anti-slavery
preaching. After President Lincoln&rsquo;s emancipation proclamation
the synods and general conferences arrayed themselves against the
system, but not before. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is a common belief in Protestant countries that
Protestantism has been the cause of all modern enlightenment,
&ldquo;overlooking,&rdquo; says Mr. Buckle, &ldquo;the important fact
that until enlightenment had begun, there was no Protestantism
required. Enlightenment was the cause of Protestantism. Many causes had
been at work to bring up the public mind to a higher intelligence and a
braver love of independence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The reformation broke out at least twenty times before
Luther, and was put down. Arnold, of Brescia was put down; Fra Dolcino
was put down; the Albigenses were put down; the Vaudois were put down;
the Lollards were put down; the Hussites were put down.&mdash;Mill, on
Liberty.</p>
</div>
<p>The reformation was therefore the result of previous enlightenment,
a demand for larger liberty. It was the protest of reason against
authority. Liberalism is the full protest against all forms of
superstition and despotism. We have greatly over-estimated the work of
the reformation. It did not greatly change the humanities of society,
as the Protestants so fondly imagine. Protestants were found to be the
persecutors when they had the power, just as the Romanists had been;
circumstances, however, modified and restrained them from such
atrocities as the latter had perpetrated.</p>

<h3 class="main">Christianity Teaches Immorality.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The doctrine of the <i>atonement</i> has been the dry
rot in our civilization. It has led millions to believe that they could
escape the consequences of violated laws of nature. Millions of people
believe to-day that they can go through life in utter disregard of all
that is right and good, and at the last moment when they come to
shuffle off this mortal coil, all they will then need to do will be
simply to call upon Jesus and receive his approbation and permission to
enter the shining courts above. &ldquo;Jesus died and paid it
all,&rdquo; relieves the votary from the demands of morality, and,
&ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>Devil tempted me and I sinned,&rdquo; exonerates
him from all guilt. This sort of teaching has filled our prisons with
those who fully believe it&mdash;and they are behind the bars because
they have lived according to their belief. The malignant and mendacious
cry that Freethought leads the truthseeker always downward to a bad
life is refuted by the fact that those who fill the prisons of our
country are not Infidels, but believers in the divine revelation who
have lived up to the advantages offered by the &ldquo;gathering them
in&rdquo; doctrine of atonement.</p>
<p>The murderers who are hanged on Friday in the different states
almost every week, nearly all Christians, are prepared to go to heaven
and there join in the company and songs of innocent children and pure
maids and matrons who, by their presence, make heaven worthy the name;
but these fiends, if they should happen to be pardoned by the governor,
there could not be found a reputable Christian who would want to take
one of them home to live in his family of noble wife and lovely
children, for a single day. And yet he is fit for heaven, fit for the
company of angels and the purified of earth. The dying words of a good
religious man were, &ldquo;I am no Infidel,&rdquo; and that man&rsquo;s
name is John D. Lee, of Utah, who, in cold blood, murdered innocent
men, women, and children, and after eluding justice for twenty years or
more was arrested, tried, found guilty and shot to death, with the
words on his lips, &ldquo;I am no Infidel.&rdquo; But his confession
was unnecessary, as Freethinkers do not die that way, and the reason
they do not die in that manner is because they do not believe in the
great bankrupt act&mdash;the atonement. They have no savior, and hence
have to save themselves. They have no titles to mansions in the skies
but have some claims on earth which they prefer to stay with as long as
they can.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the atonement is very immoral and no one can begin
to estimate the wickedness it has fostered in society, by leading
people to believe they can pass through life committing all sorts of
crimes and at last, when they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304"

<p class="first">It is immoral because it seeks to accomplish certain
ends without using the proper means, or it tries to do what reason

Memphis the praying people all over <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

in supplicating the unknown to remove the plague; but notwithstanding

<p>&ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread,&rdquo; is a childish

this prayer on their lips. Jesus made a prayer in the garden of
Gethsemane which was not answered. Now if the son of God may pray and
receive no answer, what can the common rank and file sinner expect?</p>
<p>When the native African sees an eclipse, he fancies some huge
monster is attempting to devour the sun, or the moon, as the case may

skeptical brethren and says, &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; just as his
more civilized brother who prays for rain, and after it comes, no
matter whether it is a day or a month afterward, turns upon his
incredulous friends, and asks them triumphantly, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
tell you so?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Prayer is simply supplication to God. God is a mystery; a mystery so
profound that nothing is known of him, save that he is a mystery. Even
his existence cannot be demonstrated. His non-existence is equally
undemonstrable, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306"
name="pb306">306</a>]</span>because no man has a definite conception of
him to use as a starting point for investigation. Some claim that he is
a person, others that he is omnipresent. Both of these cannot be; for
personality and omnipresence are incompatible. Prayer is based on the
supposition of his personality. It implies necessarily a person in a
certain place, and possessed of certain attributes. He must be
omnipotent, omniscient, unchangeable, and all-good. Nothing less than
this will come up to the conception of what a God should be. Christians
tell us God possesses all these attributes. We accept their statement
because it is impossible to prove the contrary. On this basis, then let
us examine prayer.</p>
<p>God is said to be all goodness. Goodness is the performance of duty.
Perfect goodness is the performance of all duty, and of nothing beyond.
It is also the performance of all duty without reluctance or
hesitation. Prayer is an insult to this quality of God&rsquo;s
character. It implies that his goodness is not perfect. Every blessing
for which man can ask, it is the duty of God either to grant or to
withhold. In either case, prayer implies the possibility of
imperfection. To ask God to grant a blessing which it is his duty to
grant, is to assume that he will not do his duty without being urged.
Such an assumption is downright insolence. To ask for a blessing which
it is God&rsquo;s duty to withhold, is to assume that he can be
persuaded to commit sin. This, too, can only be regarded as an insult.
In both cases prayer is useless, because God is not likely to grant a
blessing asked in the same breath an insult is given.</p>
<p>We are told that God is pleased with prayer, because it shows our
faith in his goodness. It rather shows our lack of faith. To be
continually asking for blessings, implies a doubt whether we shall get
them if we do ask. He who never prays shows the most faith, for he
takes it for granted that God is good, and if he is good, he will
provide for his children unasked. The child has faith that his father
will provide for him, but he never asks him to do so. Such conduct
would prove him unworthy of his father&rsquo;s care. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>So
with prayer; the praying man is the true skeptic, and the Infidel is
the true believer.</p>
<p>Prayer makes God a changeable being. It implies that he will grant
any favor we ask, whether he had previously designed to do so or not.
If we were privy to his designs, and knew what blessings he intended to
bestow, we could ask only for such as he had intended to give us. In
the absence of this knowledge we pray blindly for blessings which it
may be, he has determined to withhold. This necessarily implies that he
may change his designs. If the object pleaded for is a good one, such a
change would be perfectly proper in an earthly monarch. In God it would
be fanciful in the extreme. It would place his will at the disposal of
a million fallible human beings. It would overthrow the harmony of his
government, and replace it by the most reckless chance. Our reception
of a blessing would depend no longer on God&rsquo;s goodness; it would
depend on whether some other person of greater persuasive power, was or
was not asking an opposite blessing at the same time. God would be in
constant indecision, and we should be in constant doubt. Prayer, then,
is based on the changeableness of an unchangeable being, and therefore
valueless.</p>
<p>Prayer, in theory, is based on the supposition of God&rsquo;s
personality; prayer, in practice, assumes that God is omnipotent. It
supposes that he can be in all places at all times. People are praying
at all hours of the day and in all quarters of the globe. To hear them
all God must be at such places at such times. To do this he must cease
to be a personal being, he must cease to be God. He will then have no
intelligence, no volition, for these depend on a personal organization.
Prayer, therefore, logically annihilates the being to whom it is
addressed.</p>
<p>Prayer implies doubt of the wisdom of God. To pray is to ask for a
certain blessing. We assume that such a blessing is best for us, and
inform God of the fact. After insulting his goodness by asking for a
blessing, we insult his intelligence by specifying what that blessing
shall be. Prayers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span>are rarely or never asked for general
blessings alone. A person who asks for a blessing and leaves the choice
of that blessing wholly to God, is liable to be considered a lunatic by
all true believers. Yet to do otherwise is to deny God&rsquo;s
omniscience. It assumes that God does not know what our wants are. If
God is a rational being, he can only treat such an assumption with
contempt. Prayer has been tried for two thousand years and with no
result. No prayer has ever been directly or indirectly answered by God.
On the contrary, he apparently delighted in mocking those who call upon
him. When the Ville du Havre went down, over two hundred ministers were
praying for their lives, but in vain. Two girls who trusted not in
prayers, but in swimming-belts, alone were saved. (&ldquo;Logic of
Prayer,&rdquo; Charles Stevenson.)</p>
<p>Some years ago when the yellow fever raged at Memphis, Tennessee,
the pious people of this country prayed most devoutly to have the
plague swept away. These prayers were repeated, were offered up by the
most faithful in the Christian ranks, but all in vain. They had read in
their Bible that the prayers of the righteous availeth much. They had
been taught to believe that &ldquo;all things whatsoever ye shall ask
in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2021:22">Mat. 21&nbsp;:
22</a>.) There is no one thing that Jesus taught more explicitly than
this; the prayers of those who truly believe shall be answered. He
said:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Therefore I say unto you, What things so ever ye
desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye <i>shall
have</i> them. (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>But we see that prayers are not answered. And besides, those prayers
which it is claimed are answered carry no proof of the fact with
them.</p>
<p>Did not millions of Christians pray for the restoration of President
Garfield? How utterly delusive it is to palm off as truth the following
promise upon credulous minds:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on
earth as touching anything ye shall ask, it shall be done for them of

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=

<p>Jesus himself offered a prayer that was not answered. In the garden
of Gethsemane he prayed:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. (<a class=

<p>There is no evidence that God has ever interfered in the affairs of
men. The hand of earth is stretched uselessly toward heaven. From the
clouds there comes no help. In vain the shipwrecked cry to God. In vain
the imprisoned ask for liberty and light&mdash;the world moves on, and
the heavens are deaf and dumb and blind. The frost freezes, the fire
burns, slander smites, the wrong triumphs, the good suffer, and prayer
dies upon the lips of faith. (&ldquo;Ingersoll&rsquo;s
Interviews,&rdquo; p. 49.)</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ask and it shall be given thee&rdquo; is an erroneous and
immoral teaching. It is false. It is not true that people get what they
pray for. We hear pious persons praying, &ldquo;Give us this day our
daily bread,&rdquo; but none of them expect to get their bread in that
way. What an irresistible smile would wrinkle the faces of the devout
if a poor widow should pray: &ldquo;Give us this day our daily
coal,&rdquo; and another of the praying circle should ask, &ldquo;Give
us this day our daily potatoes,&rdquo; and another should beg,
&ldquo;Give us this day our daily beefsteak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While no one expects to get his daily supplies in answer to prayer,
yet millions of pious souls are scandalized if you doubt the efficacy
of prayer. They will admit that they have to work for their
&ldquo;daily bread,&rdquo; &ldquo;but after all God gives it to us just
the same.&rdquo; He gives it to the sinner who does not pray in the
same manner, that is, if he labors he earns his own bread.</p>
<p>In vain the seamstress in her sickness and poverty, prays,
&ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo; She dies with these her
last words on her lips.</p>
<p>In vain the noble souls who have been thrown into prison for daring
to tell and defend the truth, have fervently appealed to the judge of
all the earth for freedom.</p>
<p>In vain the martyr looked to heaven for deliverance. <span class=

<p class="first">It seems to some people selfish for one to attempt to
live in the personal enjoyment of this world, but to lend all
one&rsquo;s energies toward gaining heaven is to them just right.
Caring for one&rsquo;s health and family is selfishness, but struggling
to save one&rsquo;s soul is the noblest work of life.</p>
<p>The truth is Christian doctrines are purely selfish. When man does
certain duties, as they are called, because he wants to get to heaven,
his conduct is intensely selfish. The gospel constantly invites the
followers of Jesus to act, from the consideration that &ldquo;great is
your reward in heaven.&rdquo; Very many Christians say that if it were
not for the hope of future reward, they would not try to do right. In
other words they confess that they do not act from moral motives. They
are moved by the selfish motives of other worldliness. To act morally
we must do right because it is right and for no other consideration.
When we look beyond the act to see how much we are going to make out of
it, then our conduct is not moral. He who is going through the
performance of duties because he wants to get to heaven, has yet to
learn the meaning of morality.</p>

you cannot rely upon it&mdash;only trust in Jesus and you are
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following historical facts prove beyond question that
intolerance is the very soul of Christianity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any step was taken to establish a system of permanent
institutions, which might effectually protect liberty from the
invasions of power in general, the church <i>always</i> ranged herself
on the side of <i>despotism</i>.&rdquo; (Guizot&rsquo;s &ldquo;History
of Civilization in Europe,&rdquo; p. 154.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persecution for religious heterodoxy, in all its degrees, was
in the sixteenth century, the principle as well as the practice of
every church.&rdquo; (Hallam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Middle Ages,&rdquo; vol. 2,
p. 48.)</p>
<p>When Queen Mary, the first queen of England, had burned Latimer,
Ridley and others, and her ministers had chided her for it, she replied
that she did not think God could be angry with her for burning the
heretics a few hours in this world, for their heresy, since he was
going to burn them eternally in the next world for the same thing.</p>
<p>Here you have the <span class="corr" id="xd21e10081" title=

not intolerant, and in every age and country, with sword and hand, has
commanded the trembling people to believe or be damned. And the
Christian who does not do his utmost toward having heretics and
infidels burned at the stake, is trying to be better than his God.</p>

<p class="first">How many mortals have been frightened out of their
senses by the false alarm of fire in the next world. Preachers have
pictured to mothers their children who died without the sacraments of
the church being administered to them, as rolling on the fiery billows
of hell. Parents have been demented by such descriptions, and have gone
to lunatic asylums, or to their graves in consequence. Millions thus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>frightened have joined the church, and confessed
belief in the creed, although they may not have known the meaning of a
single article of it. But once having avowed their adherence to the
church have lived lives of hypocrisy ever afterward because they had
not the honor and the courage to break away from their bondage. What
stories the pulpit has related of Infidels being struck dead for
profanity and blasphemy. These holy pulpit alarmists will have much to
answer for if there is any such thing as a judgment day or a God in
Israel.</p>
<p>It is plain that Jesus taught the doctrine of future, if not endless
punishment. It was endless punishment to those who committed the
unpardonable sin: &ldquo;And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son
of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the
Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
neither in the world to come.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2012:32">Mat. 12&nbsp;:
32</a>.)</p>
<p>Other passages may be cited to show that Jesus taught the horrible
doctrine of eternal torment, and all efforts on the part of modern
commentators to explain away hell are in vain. &ldquo;And these shall
go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life
eternal.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p class="first">John Bunyan describes this interesting locality, and
its inhabitants thus: &ldquo;All the devils in hell will be with thee
howling and roaring, screeching and yelling in such a manner that, thou
wilt be at thy wits end, and be ready to run stark mad from anguish and
torment. * * <span class="corr" id="xd21e10108" title=

<i>scorch</i>, and <i>broil</i>, and <i>burn
forevermore</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father of New England theology, Jonathan Edwards, portrays his
own imagination after this fashion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saints in glory will be far more sensible, how dreadful
the wrath of God is, and will better understand how terrible the
sufferings of the damned are, yet this will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>be
no occasion of grief to them, but <i>rejoicings</i>. They will not be
sorry for the damned: it will cause no uneasiness or <span class="corr"
id="xd21e10134" title="Source: disatisfaction">dissatisfaction</span>
to them, but on the contrary when they see this sight, it will occasion
<i>rejoicing</i>, and excite them to <i>joyful praises</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Emmons reveals his own &ldquo;true inwardness&rdquo; by giving
it the following description:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The happiness of the elect in heaven will in part consist of
watching the torment of the damned in hell. Among these it may be their
own children, parents, husbands, wives and friends on earth. One part
of the business of the blest is to celebrate the doctrine of
reprobation. While the decree of reprobation is eternally executing on
the vessels of wrath, the smoke of their torment will be eternally
ascending in view of the vessels of mercy who instead of taking the
part of those miserable objects will sing, <i>Amen, hallelujah: praise
the Lord</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, he says: &ldquo;When they (the saints) see how great the
misery is from which God hath saved them and how great a difference he
hath made between their state and the state of others who were by
nature, and perhaps by practice no more sinful and ill deserving than
they, it will give them more a sense of the wonderfulness of
God&rsquo;s grace to them in making them so to differ. The sight of
<i>hell-torments</i> will exalt the <i>happiness</i> of the <i>saints
forever</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The Rev. Thomas Button, describes the bottomless
character of his fancies thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The godly wife shall applaud the justice of the judge in the
condemnation of her ungodly husband. The godly husband shall say, Amen!
to the damnation of her who lay in his bosom. The godly parent shall
say hallelujah! at the passing of the sentence upon the ungodly child.
And the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=

damnation of his wicked parents who begot him, and the mother who bore
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Vincent, a reverend, raves after this fashion: &ldquo;This
will fill them, the saints, with astonishing <i>admiration</i> and
<i>joy</i>, when they see some of their near relatives going to hell;
their fathers, their mothers, their children, their husbands, their
wives, their human friends, and companions while they themselves are
saved. * * * Those affections they now have for relatives <i>out</i> of
Christ will <i>cease</i>, and they will not have the least trouble to
see them sentenced to hell and thrust into the fiery

<p>Tertullian finds great joy in the idea of seeing his enemies in
hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall be the magnitude of that scene! How shall I laugh!
How shall I rejoice! How shall I triumph when I behold so many and such
illustrious kings, who were said to have mounted into heaven, groaning
with Jupiter their god, in the lowest darkness of hell.&rdquo; (Quoted
by Lecky, &ldquo;Rationalism in Europe,&rdquo; vol. 1, p. 329.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;One great objection to the Old Testament is the cruelty said
to have been commanded by God, but all the cruelties recounted in the
Old Testament ceased with death. The vengeance of Jehovah stopped at
the portal of the tomb. He never threatened to avenge himself upon the
dead; and not one word, from the first mistake in Genesis to the last
curse of Malachi, contains the slightest intimation that God will
punish in another world. It was reserved for the New Testament to make
known the frightful doctrine of eternal pain. It was the teacher of
universal benevolence who rent the <span class="corr" id="xd21e10251"
title="Source: vail">veil</span> between time and eternity, and fixed
the horrified gaze of man on the lurid gulfs of hell. Within the breast
of non-resistance was coiled the worm that never dies.&rdquo;
(Ingersoll&rsquo;s Reply to Black.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary that heaven should borrow its light from the
glare of hell? Infinite punishment is infinite cruelty, endless
injustice, immortal meanness. To worship an eternal gaoler hardens,
debases, and pollutes the soul. While there is one sad and breaking
heart in the universe, no perfectly good being can be perfectly happy.
Against the heartlessness of this doctrine every grand and generous
soul should enter its solemn protest. I want no part in any heaven
where the saved, the ransomed, and the redeemed drown with merry shout
the cries and sobs of hell&mdash;in which happiness forgets
misery&mdash;where the tears of the lost increase laughter and deepen
the dimples of joy. The idea of hell was born of ignorance, brutality,
fear, cowardice, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318"
name="pb318">318</a>]</span>revenge. This idea tends to show that our
remote ancestors were the lowest beasts. Only from dens, lairs, and
caves&mdash;only from mouths filled with cruel fangs&mdash;only from
hearts of fear and hatred&mdash;only from the conscience of hunger and
lust&mdash;only from the lowest and most debased, could come this most
cruel, heartless, and absurd of all dogmas.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s
Reply to Black.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A religion that teaches a mother that she can be happy in
heaven, with her children in hell&mdash;in everlasting
torment&mdash;strikes at the very roots of family affection. It makes
the human heart stone. Love that means no more than that, is not love
at all. No heart that has ever loved can see the object of its
affection in pain, and itself be happy. The thing is impossible. Any
religion that can make that possible is more to be dreaded than war or
famine or pestilence or death. It would eat out all that is great and
beautiful and good in this life. It would make life a mockery and love
a curse.&rdquo; (Helen H. Gardener&rsquo;s &ldquo;Men, Women, and
Gods.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;They divided the world into saints and sinners, and all the
saints were going to heaven, and all the sinners yonder. Now, then, you
stand in the presence of a great disaster. A house is on fire, and
there is seen at a window the frightened face of a woman with a babe in
her arms, appealing for help; humanity cries out, &ldquo;Will some one
go to the rescue?&rdquo; They do not ask for a Methodist, Baptist, or a
Catholic; they ask for a man. All at once there starts from the crowd
one that nobody ever suspected of being a saint; one may be, with a bad
reputation; but he goes up the ladder and is lost in the smoke and
flame; and a moment after he emerges, and the great circles of flames
hiss around him; in a moment more he has reached the window; in another
moment, with the woman and child in his arms, he reaches the ground and
gives his fainting burden to the by-standers, and the people all stand
hushed for a moment, as they always do at such times, and then the air
is rent with acclamations. Tell me that that man in going to be sent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>to hell, to eternal flames, who is willing to
risk his life rather than a woman and child should suffer from the fire
one moment! I despise that doctrine of hell! Any man that believes in
eternal hell is afflicted with at least two diseases<span class="corr"

Elizabeth it was declared from the pulpit that the introduction of
forks would demoralize the people and provoke the divine wrath.&rdquo;

<p>In the year 1444 Caxton published the first book ever printed in
England. In 1474 the then bishop of London, in a convocation of his
clergy, said, &ldquo;If we do not destroy this dangerous invention it
will one day destroy us.&rdquo; That bishop was a prophet.</p>
<p>Hume says: &ldquo;It was remarkable that no physician in Europe, who
had reached the age of forty years, ever to the end of his life adopted
Harvey&rsquo;s doctrine of the circulation of the blood, and that his
practice in London diminished extremely, from the reproach drawn on him
by that great and signal discovery. So slow is the progress in every
science even when not opposed by factitious and superstitious
prejudices.&rdquo; (Hume&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of England.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>When Buffon had published Natural History, in which was included his
&ldquo;Theory of the Earth,&rdquo; he was officially informed by the
faculty of theology in Paris that several of his propositions were
&ldquo;reprehensible and contrary to the creed of the
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Columbus asserted the rotundity of the earth, he was
ridiculed by the clergy, who maintained that &ldquo;everything would
roll off on the other side and be consumed in the fires of hell, if the
world should turn over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s experiments with the lightning, were
condemned, as he was only invoking upon himself the wrath of an angry
God. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=

<p>Professor Morse was freely ridiculed by the clergy for his attempt
to construct a telegraph.</p>
<p>Roger Bacon, who invented spectacles and improved the telescope, was
accused of having &ldquo;sold himself to the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to recall the persecutions of Copernicus,
Bruno, and Galileo on account of their discoveries in astronomy.</p>
<p>At Eaton, in Shelly&rsquo;s time, &ldquo;Chemistry was a forbidden
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We read in the life of Locke that &ldquo;there was a meeting of the
heads of the houses of Oxford, where it was proposed to censure and
discourage the reading of this essay (On the Human Understanding) and
after various debates, it was concluded that without any public censure
each head of a house should endeavor to prevent its being read in his
own college.&rdquo; (Spencer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Social Statics,&rdquo; p.
375.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to the last, the grandest of all human
undertakings (that is the circumnavigation of the earth) it is to be
remembered that Catholicism had irrevocably committed itself to the
dogma of a flat earth, with the sky as a floor of heaven, and hell in
the under world.&rdquo; (Draper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Conflict,&rdquo; p.
294.)</p>
<p>The clergy for years have ridiculed Darwinism, and scouted the
philosophy of evolution, even after the best minds of Europe had
accepted it. But after all their ridicule of Darwinism, when Darwin had
passed away the great heart of England did not fail to show the esteem
in which the people at large held him, but lovingly laid his remains to
rest in Westminster abbey with the dust of her noblest dead.</p>
<p>It is in the very nature of Christianity to persecute. It cannot
live on terms of equality with anything on earth. It must rule. It must
be supreme, and all institutions and all individuals must obey its
mandates. It has in all of its vocabulary no such word as liberty.
Every knee must bow to it, every tongue confess its authority, and
every pocket&mdash;pay it tithes. And so gigantic has been its power

they were professing, and hence had not so much even an a dream of
liberty. Poor man has been trampled in the dust, and sometimes used as
food for cannon, to satisfy the ambition of pope or king, and when not

<p class="first">William Cobbett on the English Church.&mdash;A Letter
to Lord Tenderten, Lord Chief Justice of England, April 6, 1829.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My Lord</i>: I have read the report of your
lordship&rsquo;s speech made on the 4th inst. on the second reading of
the Catholic bill; and there is one passage of it on which I think it
my duty thus publicly to remark. The passage to which I allude relates
to the <i>character</i> of the <i>law</i> established church, and also
to the probable fate that will, in consequence of this bill, attend her
in Ireland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, then, my lord, let us take your proposition
&lsquo;that there in no church so tolerant as this.&rsquo; I am sure
your lordship has never read her history; I am sure you have not. If
you had you never would have uttered these words. Not being content to
deal in general terms, I will not say she has been, and was from the
outset, the most intolerant church that the world ever saw; that she
started at first armed with halters, ripping-knives, axes, and racks;
that her footsteps were marked with blood, while her back bent under
the plunder of her innumerable innocent victims; and that for
refinement in cruelty and extent of rapacity she never had an equal,
whether corporate or sole. I will not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>thus speak of her in
general terms, but I will lay before your lordship some historical
<i>facts</i>, to make good that <i>contradiction</i> which I have given
to your words. I assert that this law-church is the most
<i>intolerant</i> church I ever read or heard of; and this assertion I
now proceed to make good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This church began to exist in 1547, and in the reign of
Edward VI. Until now the religion of the country had been for several
years, under the tyrant Henry VIII., a sort of mongrel; but now it
became wholly Protestant by <i>law</i>. The Articles of Religion and
the Common Prayer-book were now drawn up, and were established by acts
of Parliament. The Catholic altars were <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e10343" title="Source: pull">pulled</span> down in all the
churches; the priests, on pain of ouster and fine, were compelled to
teach the new religion, that is to say, to be apostates; and the people
who had been born and bred Catholics were not only punished if they
heard mass, but were also punished if they did not go to hear the new
parsons; that is to say, if they refused to become apostates. The
people, smarting under this tyranny, rose in insurrection in several
parts, and, indeed, all over the country. They complained that they had
been robbed of their religion, and of the relief to the poor which the
old church gave; and they demanded that the mass and the monasteries
should be restored, and that the priests should not be allowed to
marry. And how were they answered? The bullet and bayonet at the hands
of German troops slaughtered a part, caused another part to be
imprisoned and flogged, and the remainder to submit, outwardly, at
least, to the law-church. And now mark this tolerant and merciful
church. Many of the old monastics and priests, who had been expelled
from their convents and livings, were compelled to beg their bread
about the country, and thus found subsistence among the pious
Catholics. This was an eye-sore to the law-church, who deemed the very
existence of these men, who refused to apostatize, a libel on her.
Therefore, in company, actually in company with the law that founded
the new church came forth a law to punish beggars, by burning them in
the face with a red-hot iron <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>and by making them slaves for two
years, with power in their masters to make them wear an iron collar.
Your lordship must have read this act of Parliament, passed in the
first year of the first Protestant reign, and coming forth in company
with the Common Prayer-book. This was tolerant work, to be sure; and
fine proof we have here of this church being &lsquo;favorable to civil
and religious liberty.&rsquo; Not content with stripping these faithful
Catholic priests of their livings; not content with turning them out
upon the wide world; this tolerant church must cause them to perish
with hunger or be branded slaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such was the tolerant spirit of this church when she was
young. As to her burnings under Cranmer (who made the prayer book),
they are hardly worthy of particular notice, when we have before us the
sweeping cruelties of this first Protestant reign, during which, short
as it was, the people of England suffered so much that the suffering
actually thinned their numbers; it was a people partly destroyed, and
that, too, in the space of about six years; and this is acknowledged
even in acts of Parliament of that day. But this law-church was
established in reality during the reign of Elizabeth, which lasted
forty-five years; that is, from 1558 to 1603; and though this church
has always kept up its character, even to the present day, its deeds
during this long reign are the most remarkable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth established what she called &lsquo;a court of high
commission&rsquo; consisting chiefly of bishops of your
lordship&rsquo;s &lsquo;most tolerant church,&rsquo; in order to punish
all who did not conform to her religious creed, she being &lsquo;the
head of the church.&rsquo; This commission was empowered to have
control over the &lsquo;opinions&rsquo; of all men, and to punish all
men according to their &lsquo;discretion, short of death.&rsquo; They
had power to extort evidence by prison or the rack. They had power to
compel a man (on oath) to &lsquo;reveal his thoughts,&rsquo; and to
&lsquo;accuse his friend, brother, parent, wife, or child;&rsquo; and
this, too, on &lsquo;pain of death.&rsquo; These monsters, in order to
&lsquo;discover priests,&rsquo; and to crush the old religion,
&lsquo;fined, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>imprisoned, racked,&rsquo; and did such things
as would have made Nero shudder to think of. They sent hundreds to the
rack in order to get from them confessions, &lsquo;on which confession
many of them were put to death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not room to make even an enumeration of the deeds of
religious persecution during this long and &lsquo;tolerant&rsquo;
reign; but I will state a few of them:</p>
<p>1. It was <i>death</i> to make a new Catholic priest within the
kingdom.</p>
<p>2. It was <i>death</i> for a Catholic priest to come into the
kingdom from abroad.</p>
<p>3. It was <i>death</i> to harbor a Catholic priest coming from
abroad.</p>
<p>4. It was <i>death</i> to confess to such a priest.</p>
<p>5. It was <i>death</i> for any priest to say mass.</p>
<p>6. It was <i>death</i> for any one to hear mass.</p>
<p>7. It was <i>death</i> to <i>deny</i>, or <i>not</i> to swear, if
called on, that this woman was the head of the church of Christ.</p>
<p>8. It was an offense (punishable by heavy fine) <i>not</i> to go to
the <i>Protestant</i> church. This fine was &pound;20 a lunar month, or
&pound;250 a year, and of our present money &pound;3,250 a year.
Thousands upon thousands refused to go to the law-church; and thus the
<i>head</i> of the church sacked thousands upon thousands of estates!
The poor conscientious Catholics who refused to go to the &lsquo;most
tolerant church,&rsquo; and who had no money to pay fines, were crammed
into the jails until the counties petitioned to be relieved from
keeping them. They were then discharged, being first publicly whipped,
and having their ears bored with a red-hot iron. But this very great
&lsquo;toleration&rsquo; not answering the purpose, an act was passed
to banish for life all these non-goers to church, if they were not
worth twenty pounds, and, in case of return they were to be punished
with death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, my lord, not making loose assertions here; I am all
along stating from acts of Parliament, and the above form a small
sample of the whole; and this your lordship must know well. I am not
declaiming, but relating <span class="corr" id="xd21e10411" title=
"Source: undenible">undeniable</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>facts; with facts of
the same character, with a <i>bare list</i>, made in the above manner,
I could fill a considerable volume. The names of the persons put to
death merely for being Catholics, during this long and dreary reign,
would, especially if we were to include Ireland, form a list ten times
as long as that of our army and navy, both taken together. The usual
mode of inflicting death was to hang the victim for a short time, just
to benumb his or her faculties, then cut down and instantly rip open
the belly, and tear out the heart, and hold it up, fling the bowels
into the fire, then chop off the head, and cut the body into quarters,
then boil the head and quarters, and then hang them up at the gates of
cities, or other conspicuous places. This was done, including Ireland,
to many hundreds of persons, merely for adhering to the church in which
they had been born and bred. There were one hundred and eighty-seven
ripped up and boiled in England in the years from 1577 to 1603; that is
to say, in the last twenty-six years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign; and
these might all have been spared if they would have agreed to go to
church and hear the Common Prayer! All, or nearly all of them were
racked before they were put to death; and the cruelties in prison, and
the manner of execution, were the most horrible that can be conceived.
They were flung into dungeons, kept in their filth, and fed on
bullock&rsquo;s liver, boiled and unwashed tripe, and such things as
dogs are fed on. Edwards Genings, a priest, detected in saying mass in
Holborn, was after sentence of death offered his pardon if he would go
to church; but having refused to do this, and having at the place of
execution boldly said that he would die a thousand deaths rather than
acknowledge the Queen to be the spiritual head of the church, Topliffe,
the attorney-general, ordered the rope to be cut the moment the victim
was turned off, &lsquo;so that&rsquo; (says this historian) &lsquo;the
priest being little or nothing stunned, stood on his feet casting his
eyes toward heaven, till the hangman tripped up his heels, and flung
him on the block, where he was ripped up and quartered.&rsquo; He was
so much alive even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326"
name="pb326">326</a>]</span>after the boweling that he cried with a
loud voice, &lsquo;Oh! it smarts!&rsquo; And then he exclaimed,
&lsquo;<i>Sancte Gregorie, ora pro me</i>,&rsquo; while the hangman
having sworn a most wicked oath cried, &lsquo;Zounds! his heart is in
my hand, and yet Gregory is in his mouth!&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Wm.
Cobbett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For centuries the Irish were killed like game. We know not a
few good Englishmen who would be convulsed with the story of the murder
of Smith or Jones, but whom the killing of an O&rsquo;Tool or
O&rsquo;Dacherty, or any &lsquo;O&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mac&rsquo;
would not move in the least. That be it remembered in 1825. The
collection of tithes alone cost a million lives. Henry VIII. aggravated
all the outrages ever committed, and was determined the faith of the
Irish should undergo a radical Protestant conversion. Raleigh butchered
Limerick garrison in cold blood after Lord Grey had selected seven
hundred to be hanged. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%201">James I.</a>
confiscated one-tenth of all the land in Ireland and destroyed
thousands of lives for religion&rsquo;s sake. Protestant rectors kept
private prisons for confining all who dissented from their faith. Dr.
Leland, a Protestant clergyman, wrote that the favorite object of the
English Parliament was the total extermination of all the Catholics in
Ireland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cromwell began by massacreing for three days the garrison of
Drogheda after quarter had been promised. Whole towns were put up and
sold. The Catholics were banished from three-fourths of Ireland and
confined to Connaught, and after a certain day every one found outside
were shot or hung. Fleetwood, the reverend, said the Lord will appear
in this work. On every wolf&rsquo;s scalp and priest&rsquo;s head a
premium of &pound;5 was offered! Young girls and boys were gathered up
by the thousands and carried to the West Indies. So by 1652 was once
populous Ireland so devastated that an occupied house was a curiosity
and commented on. Says one writer, S. W. Petry, &lsquo;There perished
in 1641 over six <span class="corr" id="xd21e10431" title=
"Source: hunderd">hundred</span> thousand lives whose blood somebody
must atone to God for.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Newspaper article.) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The sword of the church was unsheathed and the world was at
the mercy of ignorant and infuriated priests, whose eyes feasted on the
agonies they inflicted. Acting as they believed, or pretended to
believe, under the command of God; stimulated by the hope of infinite
reward in another world&mdash;hating heretics with every drop of their
bestial blood; savage beyond description; merciless beyond
conception&mdash;these infamous priests in a kind of frenzied joy,
leaped upon the helpless victims of their rage. They crushed their
bones in iron boots; tore their quivering flesh with iron hooks and
pincers; cut off their lips and eyelids; pulled out their nails, and
into the bleeding quick thrust needles; tore out their tongues;
extinguished their eyes; stretched them upon racks; flayed them alive;
crucified them with their heads downward; exposed them to wild beasts;
burned them at the stake; mocked their cries and groans; ravished their
wives; robbed their children, and then prayed God to finish the holy
work in hell. Millions upon millions were sacrificed upon the altars of
bigotry. The Catholic burned the Lutheran, the Lutheran burned the
Catholic, the Episcopalian tortured the Presbyterian, the Presbyterian
tortured the Episcopalian. Every denomination killed all it could of
every other, and each Christian felt in duty bound to exterminate every
other Christian who denied the smallest fraction of his creed.... They
have imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of
each other. In the name of God every possible crime has been committed,
every conceivable outrage has been perpetrated. Brave men, tender and
loving women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been
exterminated in the name of Jesus Christ. For more than fifty
generations the church has carried the black flag. Her vengeance has
been measured only by her power. During all these years of infamy no
heretic has ever been forgiven. With the heart of a fiend she has
hated; with the clutch of avarice she has grasped; with the jaws of a
dragon she has devoured; pitiless as famine; merciless as fire; with

<p>&ldquo;Persuade men that when ascribing to the Deity justice and
mercy, they are speaking of qualities generally distinct from those
which exist among mankind&mdash;qualities which we are altogether
unable to conceive, and which may be compatible with acts which men
would term grossly unjust and unmerciful; tell them that guilt may be
entirely unconnected with a personal act that millions of infants may
be called into existence for a moment to be precipitated into a place
of torment, that vast nations may live and die, and then be rased again
to endure never-ending punishment, because they did not believe in a
religion of which they never heard, or because a crime was committed
thousands of years before they were in existence; convince them that
all this is part of a transcendentally perfect and righteous scheme,
and there is no imaginable abyss to which such a doctrine would not
lead.&rdquo; (Lecky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rationalism in Europe,&rdquo; vol.

<p>Lecky proceeds to show that men who believe in salvation by the
church will always persecute dissenters, and all history attests the
truth of his remarks. Catholics persecuted Protestants; Protestants
persecuted Puritans; and Puritans, in there turn, persecuted other
dissenters. Nor did the work stop here; though limited in their power,
yet these dissenters even to-day find ways by which they can persecute
dissenters from them without resort to physical means. There was not,
two centuries ago, a single sect that did not uphold persecution.</p>

of people was assembled in the largest open space in Rome, gathered
together by the irresistible sympathy which men always feel, with the
terrible and tragic in human existence. In the center stood a huge pile
of faggots, from out its logs and branches rose a stake, crowding
around the pile were eager and expectant faces, men of various ages and
of various characters, but all for one moment united in a common
feeling of malignant triumph, religion was about to be avenged; a
heretic was coming to expiate on that spot the crime of open defiance
to the dogmas proclaimed by the church&mdash;the crime of teaching that
the earth moved, and that there was an infinity of worlds. The stake is
erected for the &lsquo;maintenance and defense of the holy church, and
the rights and liberties of the same.&rsquo; Whom does the crowd await?
Giordano Bruno&mdash;the poet, philosopher, and heretic&mdash;the
teacher of Galileo&rsquo;s heresy&mdash;the friend of Sir Philip
Sidney, and the open antagonist of Aristotle. A hush comes over the
crowd. The procession solemnly advances, the soldiers peremptorily
clearing the way for it. His face is placid though pale. They offer him
the crucifix; he turns his head; he <i>refuses to kiss it</i>!
&lsquo;The heretic!&rsquo; They show him the image of him who died upon
the cross for the sake of the living truth&mdash;he refuses the symbol!

unalterable. They light the faggots; the branches crackle; the flame
ascends; the victim writhes&mdash;and now we see him no more. The smoke
envelopes him; but not a prayer, not a plaint, not a single cry escapes
him. In a little while the wind has scattered the ashes of Giordano
Bruno.&rdquo; (G. H. Lewes&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Philosophy.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a contrast between this scene of manly honor, of
unshaken firmness, of inflexible adherence to the truth, and that other
scene which took place more than fifteen centuries previously by the

<p>&ldquo;But the most powerful consideration with a truly benevolent
man, if he be a Christian, for the extirpation of heresy by force, is
the belief that its unfortunate victims will suffer unending torments
in hell. Not for a few days, not for a few years must they suffer, but
<i>forever</i>. Under the burden of such an awful thought can the
sincere, kind-hearted Christian fold his arms and look calmly upon the
efforts of men who are spreading unbelief or heresy in every direction,
who are not only going to hell themselves, but are taking with them
thousands of their fellow men. Is it not natural that the sincere
Christian, having the power, should suppress such opinions? that if
necessary he should resort to coercive measures? that if new heresies
are constantly springing up he should punish some of the offenders with
severity, and thereby endeavor to deter others from leaving the true
faith? Under the influence of such a faith, must not the desire for the
suppression of the heresy be a measure of the desire for the
suppression of the most injurious and dangerous errors? and will not
the zeal to destroy them be in proportion to the love of truth and
regard for the welfare of humanity? Will not, therefore, the most
sincere, earnest, and devoted Christians, in an age of unquestioning
faith, be the most active and zealous persecutors? On <i>a priori</i>
grounds we cannot help arriving at such a conclusion, and the facts of
history attest the correctness of the conclusion thus arrived at from a
consideration of the natural effects of the doctrine that certain
opinions involve merit and others guilt.</p>

from the stains of vice, and who were actuated in their cruel work of
torturing and burning men, by the most philanthropic motives. Many of
the worst persecutors, Catholic and Protestant alike, as Mr. Buckle has
mentioned, have been among the most conscientious of men and women.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=

What, they argued, are the fleeting pains of a few thousand men
compared with the eternal agony of the thousands and tens of thousands
they will, unless checked, lead to hell. Thus argued the Christians
when they first obtained power and used it in killing Pagans; thus
argued the Catholics of the Middle Ages; thus argued the Protestants of
Geneva; thus argued the advocates of Episcopacy, the defenders of the
Kirk of Scotland, and the pious Puritans of New England. In proportion
as men believe that correct theological beliefs involve merit and are
essential to salvation, and that theological errors involve guilt and
are punished with torments in hell, and have power, they must be
persecutors. Such has been the case in the past. It was only when
rationalism, acting in opposition to the church, rendered persecution
impossible, that theologians discovered that the punishment of men was
at variance with their religion. &lsquo;With the merits of this
pleasing though tardy conversion,&rsquo; says Lecky, &lsquo;I am not
now concerned; but few persons, I think, can follow the history of
Christian persecution without a feeling of extreme astonishment that
some modern writer, not content with maintaining that the doctrine of
exclusive salvation ought not to have produced persecution, have
ventured, in defiance of unanimous testimony of theologians of so many
centuries, to dispute the plain historical fact that it did produce
it.<span class="corr" id="xd21e10620" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;History of Morals,&rdquo;
vol. 1, p. 422.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;But independently of the influence of the Old Testament
teachings, the Christian system makes persecution inevitable in
proportion as the system is believed. Intolerance and persecution are a
natural result of the doctrine that certain religious opinions involve
moral guilt. The Bible declares, &lsquo;He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned.&rsquo;
This makes unbelief and heresy a crime, and unbelievers and heretics
criminals. It makes it the religious duty of Christians to legislate
for the extirpation of the former and the punishment of the latter. Can
men treat with charity and kindness <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

believe God is displeased&mdash;those who are spreading doctrines that
are regarded as plainly an offense to God? Is it not the wish of God
that unbelief and heresy should be destroyed, and, as an obedient
subject, is it not natural that the Christian should, as far as
possible, carry out the wishes of the God he worships?<span class=

murder. They got the evidence, but he confessed that he did it.

<p>&ldquo;Llorente, who had free access to the archives of the Spanish
Inquisition, assures us that by that tribunal alone more than 31,000
persons were burnt, and more than 290,000 condemned to punishment less
severe than death. The number of those put to death for their religion
in the Netherlands alone, in the reign of Charles V. has been estimated
by a very high authority at 50,000, and at least half as many perished
under his son. (Ibid. pp., 40, 41.)</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;How has the church in every age, when in
authority, defended itself? Always by a statute against blasphemy,
against argument, against free speech. And there never was such a
statute that did not stain the book that it was in and that did not
certify to the savagery of the men who passed it. Never. By making a
statute and by defining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>blasphemy, the church sought to
prevent discussion&mdash;sought to prevent argument, sought to prevent
a man from giving his honest opinion. Certainly a tenet, a dogma, a
doctrine, is safe when hedged about by a statute that prevents your
speaking against it. In the silence of slavery it exists. It lives
because lips are locked. It lives because men are slaves.&rdquo;
(Ingersoll, &ldquo;The Reynolds Blasphemy Trial.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I say if you believe the Bible say so; if you do not
believe it say so. And here is the vital mistake, I might almost say,
in Protestantism itself. The Protestants when they fought the
Catholics, said: &lsquo;Read the Bible for yourselves&mdash;stop taking
it from your priests&mdash;read the sacred volume with your own eyes.
It is a revelation from God to his children, and you are the
children,&rsquo; and then they said: &lsquo;If after you read it you do
not believe it, and you say anything against it, we will put you in
jail, and God will put you in hell.&rsquo; That is a fine position to
get a man in. It is like a man who invited his neighbor to come and
look at his pictures, saying: &lsquo;They are the finest in the place,
and I want your candid opinion. A man who looked at them the other day
said they were daubs, and I kicked him down stairs&mdash;now I want
your candid judgment.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Ibid.)</p>

<h3 class="main">Popular Questions and Objections.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. It is objected that Freethought is destructive, not
constructive.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) It is destructive of error, crime, cruelty, superstition
and all kinds of wrong and oppression.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) It is constructive in its defense and support of the
rights of man, woman, and child.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) It is constructive in seeking to establish the highest
form of morality, that is, rational morality.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) It is constructive, because it inspires man with a thirst
for knowledge, and puts him in sympathy with science. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) It is positive and reconstructive in inspiring man with
moral courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give us in place of religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) We would put in place of religion, liberty, morality,
honesty, courage, knowledge, and manliness.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) We do not wish to take away the Golden Rule; but we
insist that it is not a Christian precept. It was in the world long
before Jesus, before Moses, and before Abraham. Long before the
pyramids were built mothers called their children to their knees and
said to them, &ldquo;Children be good to each other to-day.&rdquo; This
is the Golden Rule. We see then that it is of human origin, and not a
part of Christianity, as Christianity is founded upon the supernatural.
It is the old, old way that religions have of borrowing human virtues
and ascribing them to the gods.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) We do not teach men to <span class="corr" id="xd21e10789"
title="Source: dispise">despise</span> charity, but to so improve human
conditions that charity and charitable institutions shall not be
needed.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) &ldquo;What will you give us in place of the
Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not propose to take it away. We only ask people to read it as
they do other books&mdash;accepting the good and rejecting the bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to have in place of the consolation of the
gospel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gospel means glad tidings. What are the glad tidings?</p>
<p>1. That man is totally depraved and polluted. Good news!</p>
<p>2. That he deserves eternal torment. Glad tidings!</p>
<p>3. And that nine tenths of the human race will get their deserts.
&ldquo;Many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo; Glorious news!</p>
<p>4. That hell is in view,&mdash;near at hand. Delightful tidings!</p>
<p>5. That the reprobate cannot escape. Glorious gospel!</p>
<p>6. That God hates the most of the race and has from eternity doomed
them to eternal woe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341"
name="pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>And all this is the gospel of glad tidings!</p>
<p>Suppose we expose the delusion of eternal torments, what does man
want in its place? Does he need a smaller hell to taper off on, before
he can give up hell altogether? What does any one want in place of
<i>infant damnation</i>? And so also with witchcraft, polygamy,
slavery, and many other wrongs&mdash;must we have something to take
their place? I heard of a kid gloved dude, who put his finger into a
bucket of water, and after taking it out looked for the hole in the
water. As well might the poor fellow sick in the hospital ask the
doctor, who promises to cure him of the small pox, what he will give
him in its stead. Does he want the itch or measles in place of the
small pox?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the Freethinker come to know so much more than
millions of good and great men who for eighteen centuries have believed
in Christianity?&rdquo; (<i>a</i>) Here we have the old question of
majorities.</p>
<p>Millions of good and great men once firmly believed in
witchcraft.</p>
<p>Luther said: &ldquo;I would have no compassion on these witches, I
would burn them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Wesley said: &ldquo;Giving up witchcraft is giving up the
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Matthew Hale believed in witchcraft.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The good and great men of many ages believed in
hell&mdash;that is, for somebody else. Practically hell is now in the
lower case, if not entirely closed up for repairs.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Millions of good and wise men for many centuries believed
that this earth was flat, and that the sun went daily round it. And
these good and wise people burned all those who did not agree with
them.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Millions of the best of earth at one time believed that
it was right and proper to hang a man for stealing a sheep.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) At one time almost every body believed that it was
well-pleasing to God, for Christians to torture and murder heretics.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Millions of the wisest and best men have at different
times believed that the world was speedily coming to an end.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) The great men of the past <i>professed</i> to believe in
Christianity because they were <i>compelled</i> to do so through fear
of persecution, torture, and death. Millions of prominent men in
society to-day, have to <i>pretend</i> to believe in the doctrines of
the church in order to be <i>respectable</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) In every country under the sun people believe in their
own religion.&mdash;The good and great Mohammedans, believe in
Islamism. The good and great Buddhists believe in Buddhism, and the
good and great Brahmins, believe in Brahminism.</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) The wise men of to-day in Europe and America do not
believe in Christianity. The men of science do not attempt to prove the
claims of Christianity.</p>
<p>It is claimed that Infidelity is demoralizing in its tendency.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) With such lives before us as those of Paine, Ingersoll,
Palmer, Bennett, Wright, Seaver, and many others this charge proves to
be groundless.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Liberal principles are not degrading. Truth, liberty, and
justice cannot demoralize, but blind faith does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidels always repent on their death bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Paine did not. Bennett did not. Dr. T. Brown did not.
Courtlandt Palmer, Horace Seaver, Elizur Wright, did not&mdash;and
millions of other good men have died tranquilly without any belief
whatever in another world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can Infidelity save the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing is certain, namely, that Christianity cannot do it, as it
has been trying to do so for eighteen centuries.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as salvation possible.</p>
<p>The world can be improved most rapidly by allowing everyone to mind
his own business&mdash;by giving man his natural and equal rights, by
inspiring him with liberty, for nothing so fully prepares people for
liberty as liberty itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has Freethought done for the world?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) What has Christianity done for the world? Why it has
built schools, churches, and charitable institutions.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) It is true that Christianity instituted schools,
colleges, and universities; but not for the purpose of educating the
people in truth, but in only such knowledge as would not conflict with
its own superstitions. Christian schools have been for ages at war with
science and liberty.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) It is true that the church builds asylums for the
poor&mdash;but it is the church that is in a large degree responsible
for the impoverished condition of the people. And the very money that
builds the almshouse was begged from the poor, by the church. The
church has nothing of itself to give except preaching. When the church
builds an institution it first becomes a beggar.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The church builds insane asylums. And the church has
filled them with her own people. There are more people made crazy and
insane by religious excitements than by any other one thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have Infidels given for education, charity, and
science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will give the names of six noted Freethinkers, and could give
more, but give these six to begin with: Stephen Girard, Robert Owen,
James Lick, William Maclure, John Rodman, and Peter Brigham. These
gentleman who were all Infidels, gave at least fifteen millions of
dollars for education, science, and charity. The vast sum given by
Stephen Girard for a secular education of orphan children has been
stolen by Christians and put to another use.</p>

<h3 class="main">Orthodoxy and Liberalism Compared.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Orthodoxy has a creed, but Liberalism has none. A
creed is something you do not understand, but it is nevertheless
necessary for you to profess that you believe it&mdash;and the more
unreasonable and impossible this something is the greater merit you
have in saying you believe it.</p>
<p>2. Orthodoxy has a Bible. Liberalism accepts all bibles and books
for what they are worth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href=
"#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. Orthodoxy has a savior&mdash;Liberalism seeks to make all men
saviors.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that the orthodox savior has failed after
trying for eighteen centuries. He even fails to save his own professed
people and to make them any better than other folks.</p>
<p>4. Orthodoxy has a prospective heaven. Liberalism takes no stock in
harps and crowns in the sky country&mdash;and is not terrorized by
smoke from the sulphur lake.</p>
<p>5. Orthodoxy insists that the most imperative duty is to
<i>believe</i>, while Liberalism teaches that man should think,
question, and investigate, and always be governed by reason.</p>
<p>The one preaches &ldquo;he that hath ears to hear, let him hear (us
the preachers);<span class="corr" id="xd21e10968" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> the other teaches that &ldquo;he who has
brains to think, let him think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. Orthodoxy commands you to obey. Liberalism inspires you to defy
despotism and to love liberty.</p>
<p>7. Orthodoxy tells you that there is merit in believing. Liberalism
shows you that there is no merit in belief.</p>
<p>8. Orthodoxy maintains that belief is subject to one&rsquo;s will.
Liberalism proves that intelligent belief depends upon <i>evidence</i>,
and that religious beliefs are inherited.</p>
<p>9. Orthodoxy hinges most of its teachings upon the <i>traditions</i>
of the past, the mysteries of the present and the hopes of an
<i>imaginary</i> future.</p>
<p>Liberalism admits of no postponement. &ldquo;One world at a
time,&rdquo; and now is the time.</p>
<p>10. Orthodoxy is opposed to the teachings of science. See the lives
of Galileo, Bruno, Copernicus.</p>
<p>11. Orthodoxy persecutes her own followers; for example: Dr. Thomas,
Professor Swing, Professor William Robertson Smith of Aberdeen College,
Scotland, Professor Winchell of Vanderbilt University, Professor
Blauvelt, Professor John Miller of Princeton, New Jersey, and hosts of
others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>12. Orthodoxy seeks to guide men by authority, mottoes, and texts.
Liberalism inspires man to govern and guide himself through the
exercise of his own reason.</p>
<p>13. Orthodoxy teaches that the innocent must suffer that the guilty
may escape. Liberalism teaches that <i>justice</i> should be meted out
to all. The great scheme of salvation failed because it was a
&ldquo;scheme.&rdquo; It is now pretty well known as a &ldquo;bankrupt
scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14. &ldquo;The Bible has stood the attack of Infidelity during
eighteen centuries.&rdquo; Ignorance has stood the attack of knowledge
for a much longer time, and yet ignorance has not so very materially
suffered&mdash;it is still ignorance.</p>
<p>Vice has stood the attacks of virtue ever since the world began.
Superstition has been besieged by science for many centuries, and yet
superstition seems hale and hearty and bids fair to have a long life.
Is it true that those who believe in the Bible are willing to have it
tested by reason, justice, or humanity? It is not true that it has
stood the test of science. Christians are not willing to have the Bible
tested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Infidel rejects the religion of his mother.&rdquo; Not
always; but even suppose it were true, did not Jesus reject the
religion of his mother? Did not Paul, Peter, Luther, Wesley&mdash;did
they not all reject the religion of their mothers?</p>
<p>Does not preaching consist in asking people to reject the religion
of their mothers and to come over to the <span class="corr" id=

religion?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freethinkers are ruthless, and do not care how much they hurt
our feelings. They speak coarsely upon sacred subjects.&rdquo; Yes; but
do not Christians hurt our feelings? They send us to hell, and then put
on a look of injured innocence if we do not sweetly return them
&ldquo;thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is often charged that Freethinkers do not believe anything. While
it is true that we are not strong in any form of religious beliefs, yet
it is true that we have most positive and decided convictions in regard
to this world. We advocate freedom, truth, justice, equity, and every
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>known human virtue. These all have an existence,
we believe in all these present existing virtues. We believe in the
realities, but the saint believes in the unrealities. He relishes as
the meat and drink of his soul, such airy nothings as: dreams, visions,
trances, inspirations, revelations, mysteries, miracles, witches, evil
spirits, demons, devils, angels, immaculate conception, raising of the
dead, drinking poison with impunity, omens, signs, sorcery, magic,
resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are fools for <span class="corr" id="xd21e11023" title=
"Source: Christ">Christ&rsquo;s</span> sake,&rdquo; says the apostle,
and in the language of the Quaker, we must say, we have not the heart
to contradict him.</p>
<p>It is objected that &ldquo;Freethought has no moral
standard.&rdquo;&mdash;Yes it has&mdash;it has Reason the only true
lamp to man&rsquo;s path. &ldquo;But Reason is fallible, you can not
always trust it.&rdquo; You cannot always trust the reason of him who
is not well developed mentally and well informed. But the Bible is
fallible, and always fallible, and you can trust it in but very few
places except where it presents truth; and this moral truth is older
than it. So we could get along <i>without</i> the Bible, but we could
hardly get along without Reason, although some people try to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is <i>no agreement</i> among
<i>Freethinkers</i>.&rdquo; That is their glory. Freethought has no
procrustean bed upon which it may bring all of its constituency to one
and the same size. The glory of Freethought is that it inspires man to
become free and possess his liberty against all invaders. To be free is
to be a man, and not to be free is to be a slave.</p>
<p>Is there, let me ask, anything like agreement among the creeds? Have
the Bible expounders always seen eye to eye? Do the biblical critics
all harmonize? Where, I would like to know, can you find more
disagreement than in the Christian church?</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Infidelity is honest. When it reaches the
confines of reason, it says: I know no further. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity does not palm its guess upon the ignorant as a
demonstration. Infidelity proves nothing by slander&mdash;establishes
nothing by abuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity has nothing to hide. It has no &lsquo;holy of
holies,&rsquo; except the abode of truth. It has no curtain that the
hand of investigation has not the right to draw aside. It lives in the
cloudless light, in the very noon of human eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity has no bible to be blasphemed. It does not cringe
before an angry god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity says to every man: Investigate for yourself. There
is no punishment for unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity asks for no protection from legislatures. It wants
no man fined because he contradicts its doctrines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity relies simply upon evidence&mdash;not evidence of
the dead, but of the living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity has no infallible pope. It relies only on
infallible fact. It has no priest except the interpreter of nature. The
universe is its church. Its bible is everything that is true. It
implores every man to verify every word for himself, and it implores
him to say if he does not believe it, that he does not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity does not fear contradiction. It is not afraid of
being laughed at. It invites the scrutiny of all doubters, of all
unbelievers. It does not rely upon awe, but upon reason. It says to the
whole world: It is dangerous <i>not</i> to think. It is dangerous
<i>not</i> to be honest. It is dangerous <i>not</i> to investigate. It
is dangerous <i>not</i> to follow where reason leads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infidelity requires every man to judge for himself.
Infidelity preserves the manhood of man.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s

<h3 class="main">The Objects of Orthodoxy and Liberalism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Liberalism, like all reform movements, is poorly
understood by all the masses. The more ignorant of the clergy know
nothing of its real objects, and the few who do understand it dare not
tell the truth, therefore we can not refer to its real objects too
often. In this article we propose to place side by side the principle
objects of Orthodoxy and Liberalism without comment so that our readers
will be able to study them in contrast and see which is the more
reasonable.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy seeks first and above all to glorify God; Liberalism seeks
first and above all to glorify man.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy seeks to save men from hell; Liberalism seeks to save them
from vice, ignorance, and superstition.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy teaches men how to die; Liberalism teaches them how to
live.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy says believe and be saved; Liberalism says behave and be
saved.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy promises happiness to the elect in another world;
Liberalism seeks to make all happy in this one.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy encourages men to seek for mansions in the skies;
Liberalism encourages them to secure homes on earth.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy teaches men to rely on God and pray; Liberalism teaches
them to rely on themselves and work.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy teaches self-abnegation; Liberalism teaches
self-respect.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy tells you what the Bible means; Liberalism takes it for
granted the Bible means what it says.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy says salvation is by faith only; Liberalism says it is by
honesty, education, and industry.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy offers a substitute for the sins of such as believe;
Liberalism expects every man to answer for his own acts. (Independent

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&ldquo;Safest to Believe.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has often been argued that credulity is safer than
skepticism&mdash;that &ldquo;it is safest to believe;&rdquo; inasmuch
as if a man believes in heaven and hell, and there be no such places,
he is, if no gainer, at least no loser; whereas the Infidel may lose,
and cannot gain. Upon the same principle, it were safest to believe all
the religions of the world at once&mdash;Christian, Mohammedan, Jewish,
Hindoo, Confucian, and all the rest; because it is but insuring the
matter by halves to trust to one only. If Allah be not the only God and
Mahomet be an imposter, there is no harm done and nothing lost; and if
there be not a paradise in another world, there has been a pleasant
dream of anticipated joys in this.</p>
<p>Let us ask, is the balance of profit and loss fairly struck? Are the
chances all in favor of the believer and all against the skeptic? Is
there nothing to be thrown into the opposite scale? Surely much. If
religion be a fallacy, it is a fallacy pregnant with mischief. It
excites the fears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352"
name="pb352">352</a>]</span>without foundation; it fosters feelings of
separation between the believer and the unbeliever; it consumes
valuable time that can never be recalled, and valuable talents that
ought to be better employed; it draws money from our pockets to support
a delusion; it teaches the elect to look upon their fellow men as
heathen and castaways, living in sin here, and doomed to perdition
hereafter; it awakens harassing doubts, gloomy despondency, and fitful
melancholy; it turns our thoughts from the things of the world, where
alone true knowledge is found; it speaks of temporal miseries and
temporal pleasures as less than nothing and vanity, and thus fosters
indifference to the causes of the weal and woe of mankind; worse than
all, it chains us down to an antiquated orthodoxy, and forbids the free
discussion of those very subjects which it most concerns us to
investigate. If religion be a fallacy, its votaries are slaves.
Whereupon, then, rests the assertion, that if the believer does not
gain, he cannot lose? Is it nothing to lose time and talents, to waste
our labor on that which is not bread, and our money upon that which
profiteth not? Is it nothing to feel that the human beings that
surround us are children of the devil and heirs of hell? Is it nothing
to think that we may perhaps look across the great gulf and see some
one we have loved on earth tormented in a fiery lake; and hear him ask
us to dip a finger in water that it may cool his parched tongue? Is it
no loss to live in disquiet by day, and in fear by night; to pass
through dark seasons of doubt and temptation, and to be conscious that
we are but as strangers and pilgrims here, toiling through a weary
valley of cares and sorrows? Is it no loss to hold back when truth
oversteps the line of orthodoxy, and when there ought to be free
discussion, to shrink before we know not what? Is all this no loss? Or,
is it not rather the loss of all that a free and rational being most
values?</p>
<p>Those engaged in the trade of religion, imagine themselves to have a
mighty advantage against Infidels upon the strength of the old, worn
out argument that whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>the Christian religion be true or
false there can be no harm in believing; and that belief is, at any
rate, the safer side. Now to say nothing of this old popish argument,
which a sensible man must see is the very essence of popery, and would
oblige us to believe all the absurdities and nonsense in the world:
inasmuch as if there be no harm in believing, and there be some harm
and danger in not believing, the <i>more</i> we believe, the better;
and all the argument for any religion whatever would be, that it should
frighten us out of our wits; the more terrible, the more true; and it
would be our duty to become the converts of that religion, whatever it
might be, whose priests could swear the loudest, and damn and curse the
fiercest. This is a wolfish argument in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. (Truth
Seeker tract.)</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Ours is the safe side,&rdquo; says the
Christian; &ldquo;for if Infidelity be true then both Infidel and
Christian have the same destiny, namely to die and end all, but if
Christianity be true what will become of the Infidel?&rdquo; In reply
to this we say, that although at death both believer and unbeliever
fall asleep side by side upon the bosom of mother earth, yet it does
not make yours the safe side; because if Christianity be true then the
most of the human race go into eternal torment. Orthodoxy has always
taught that &ldquo;many are called but few are chosen.&rdquo; Now if
nine tenths of the race are going to suffer endless pain I do not see
how those who are going to constitute a large part of that number and
are to be eternally lost, can call it the &ldquo;safe side.&rdquo; For
it should not be forgotten that the vast majority of those who are
going to suffer the wrath of God, are professed Christians. &ldquo;Many
will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
name? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I
profess unto them&mdash;I never knew you, depart from me ye that work
iniquity.&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>No, no, it will not do to trust that side as the &ldquo;safe
side&rdquo; where &ldquo;many are called but few are chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need something safer than that.</p>
<p>Again, we do not see how it can be the &ldquo;safe side,&rdquo; to
despise this life, in hopes of another that we know nothing of. If
Infidelity be true, all Christians are superstitious idolaters. If
Infidelity be true, Christians are deceived and are corrupting the
minds of millions of children with superstition which will render them
bigoted, cruel, and unhappy. And this is about the size of it. How,
then, can it be the safe side. The safe side is always to be fair and
honorable. It is safe always to examine both sides. It is safe to be on
the alert for more truth. It is safe to accept the truth even when it
cuts away old prejudices and old beliefs. It is safe not to be a
sectarian. It is not safe to be a partizan, but it is safe to be free,
courageous, and honest in all things. It is not safe for you to cling
to myths, fables, and superstitions, and to leave them as a blighting
inheritance to your children.</p>

<h3 class="main">Popular Objections to Infidelity Answered, Showing
Some Mistakes of Christians.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. That we are negative, only.&mdash;We deny what we
deem to be false, we affirm what we believe to be true, Christians do
the same; only much that they affirm, we deny, and much that they deny,
we affirm. Negation is necessary and healthful. No affirmation is
possible that does not presuppose a negation. Negation is but the
assailing side of affirmation. We deny the fables of mythology; we
affirm the demonstrable truths of science.</p>
<p>2. That we have no incentive to good deeds.&mdash;If the Christian
acts as he believes, he does good to escape hell and gain
heaven&mdash;he respects the rights of others through fear of
punishment and hope of reward. Hence it is that he cannot understand
how the man who rejects his creed can be a good man. We do right
because all the experience of the race has shown that what we call
&ldquo;right&rdquo; is conducive to happiness; because the line of
right action is the line <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href=
"#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>of least resistance; because we
believe in the principle of reciprocity, and because every act of every
individual becomes a part of the inheritance of the race, and thus as
we are, so shall be our children. If we are intemperate, diseased, and
criminal, our children shall suffer in consequence thereof. What higher
or stronger incentive to right action can be offered?</p>
<p>3. That we are unhappy.&mdash;Why should we be more unhappy than the
Christian? Why should we not be more happy? We live in the same world;
we believe in making the most of its opportunities for obtaining
happiness, while he (theoretically, at least,) believes that earthly
joy depreciates heavenly bliss; we are cursed by no fear of an angry
God, by no dreams of an endless hell and of a revengeful devil; the
Christian no more than the Infidel, is exempt from accident, sickness
and death, and the agony of parting with loved ones is his no less than
ours. He accepts Revelation and Creation, and hence believes that we
belong to a falling race; we accept Science and Evolution, and hence
believe that we belong to a rising race. Which is the most rational and
hope inspiring belief?</p>
<p>4. That it is &ldquo;safest to believe.&rdquo;&mdash;If this proves
anything it proves too much. If our future (if we have one) can be
rendered more secure by pretending to believe when we do not, then the
Protestant should accept Catholicism, and the Catholic, Protestantism,
while the members of every sect should believe all that is taught by
all other sectarists and Christians of every school should believe all
that is contained in the sacred books of other religions.</p>
<p>5. That we hurt the feelings of those who cherish the old
faith.&mdash;Why should the Christian complain that we disturb settled
convictions and cut loose the anchored bark of faith? Has not
Christianity ever been a missionary religion? It seeks to disturb the
religion of the whole world. Christians attack all religions other than
their own&mdash;our offence is that we include Christianity in the
category of false faiths. (Lucifer.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;All Owing to the Bible.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is a very common argument with Christians,
that only those nations which have had the Bible are refined, civilized
and learned. The following is the boastful manner in which Christians
set forth the claims of their religion: &ldquo;Take a map of the world,
draw a line around those countries that have enjoyed the highest degree
of refinement, and you will encircle just those nations that have
received the Bible as their authority in religion.&rdquo; In refutation
of this assumption Horace Seaver writes: &ldquo;From this language the
plain inference is, that those nations have been indebted to the
influence of the Bible for the positions to which they have attained.
Let us follow out a little this line of argument and see where it will
lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient Egyptians stood as far in advance of their
contemporaries as do the nations of Christendom at the present day, as
the remains of their cities and temples fully attest. And if the
argument is good, they were indebted for that superiority to their
worship of cats, crocodiles, and onions!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient Greek might have exclaimed, as he beheld the
proud position to which Greece attained&mdash;&lsquo;See what we owe to
a belief in our glorious mythology; we have reached the highest point
of enlightenment the world has ever witnessed; we stand unequaled in
power, wealth, the cultivation of the arts, and all that makes a nation
refined, polished, and great!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How immeasurably would his faith in the elevating tendency of
<i>his</i> religion have been increased could he have looked with
prophetic eye into the distant ages of the future, and beheld the
enlightened and <i>Christianized</i> nations of the nineteenth century
adopting the remains of Grecian architecture, sculpture, painting,
oratory, music and literature as their models! Pagan Rome, too, once
mistress of the world and arbitress of nations&mdash;the home of
philosophers and sages&mdash;the land in which the title &lsquo;I am a
Roman citizen,&rsquo; was the proudest that mortal could
wear&mdash;Rome, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357"
name="pb357">357</a>]</span>by the above Christian argument, should
have ascribed all her honor, praise, and glory to her mythology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Turk and the Saracen, likewise, have had their day of
power and renown. Bagdad was the seat of science and learning at a time
when the nations of Europe were sunk in darkness and superstition. The
Turk and Saracen should have pointed to the Koran as the source of
their refinement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus we see that the Christian argument we are noticing, if
it proves anything, it proves too much. If the nations of Christendom
are indebted to the Bible for their enlightenment, likewise were the
Egyptians indebted to their cat and crocodile and onion worship, the
Greeks and Romans to their mythology and the Turks and Saracens to
their Koran.&rdquo;&mdash;Seaver.</p>
<p>The following is from William Denton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Common Sense
Thoughts on the Bible:&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it is well known, that in those countries where
the Bible is read, studied, and believed in, there is more knowledge
and greater freedom, more virtue and happiness, than in any other
countries.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If true, and if all this was the result of reading and
believing the Bible, it would not prove the Bible to be divine. A book
may be useful, though merely human. But where is the proof that we owe
our virtue, liberty, and <span class="corr" id="xd21e11312" title=
"Source: enlightment">enlightenment</span> to the Bible? The
Abyssinians have had the Bible in their possession twice as long as the
Anglo-Saxons, and yet they are a race of barbarians still. What did the
Bible accomplish for the people of Syria, and Asia Minor, who were
first blessed with it? So little, that the Koran superseded it; the
Mohammedans being superior in almost every respect, to the Christians
whom they conquered and converted. The Greeks and Romans were as far in
advance of surrounding nations as we are or profess to be. Was it the
Bible that elevated and made them and made their unsurpassed poets,
painters, sculptors, and orators? Their priests, doubtless, attributed
their superiority to the superior religion they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=

reform to the last; but when they triumph in spite of their opposition,
they are the first to shout glory to the Bible for what it has
accomplished.&rdquo;&mdash;Denton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a conversation with a gentleman once&mdash;and these
gentlemen are always mistaking something that goes along with a thing
for the cause of the thing&mdash;and he stated to me that his
particular religion was the cause of all advancement. I said to him,
&lsquo;No, sir; the causes of all advancement in my judgment, are plug
hats and suspenders.&rsquo; And I said to him, &lsquo;You go to Turkey,
where they are semi-barbarians, and you won&rsquo;t find a pair of
suspenders or a plug hat in all that country; you go to Russia, and you
will find now and then a pair of suspenders at Moscow or St.
Petersburg; but you go on down until you strike Austria, and black hats
begin; then you go to Paris, Berlin, and New York, and you will find
everybody wears suspenders and everybody wears black hats. Wherever you
find education and music, there you will find black hats and
suspenders.&rsquo; He said that any man who said to him that plug hats
and suspenders had done more for mankind than the Bible and religion he
would not talk to.&rdquo; (Ingersoll&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ghosts.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just think of it, Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union

<p>&ldquo;Rev. Mr. Stevenson to the box! Repeat your testimony, please.
&lsquo;I said that, The education of the children of the republic in

<p>&ldquo;This is said regarding the manumitted Hebrew slave. And so it
is a <i>blessing</i> for God to give the fruit of the wine-press to his
children? And we are to emulate him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that God punishes his people by blasting their
vineyards, and thus cutting short their supply of wine, as below:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verse 51 of the same chapter tells the people that their
cattle and wine and oil shall be taken from them if they disobey
God&rsquo;s commands. This is the famous &lsquo;cursing chapter&rsquo;
of the Bible, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360"

man believe that God was the first pope of Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuteronomy is a very good book for the Woman&rsquo;s
<i>Christian</i> Temperance Union, and I suggest that it hold a special
meeting to pray for the evidently &lsquo;rum&rsquo;-loving god who
wrote it. There is much other matter in it that helps to make it an
admirable work for use in the schools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second Sam. 6&nbsp;: 19: &lsquo;And he dealt among all the
people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women
as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a

<p>&ldquo;Query: What would the <i>Christian</i> temperance ladies have
done with that wine had they been present when David, the man after
God&rsquo;s own heart, dealt it out to all, men as well as women?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second Sam. 16&nbsp;: 2: &lsquo;And Ziba said, The asses be
for the king&rsquo;s household to ride on; and the bread and summer
fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine that such as faint in the
wilderness may drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Kansas and Iowa many get &lsquo;faint in the
wilderness,&rsquo; judging by the business of the drugstores. No doubt
they have all seen this prescription given by God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second Chron. 2&nbsp;: 10: &lsquo;And behold, I will give to

beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty

<p>&ldquo;The article which Solomon, &lsquo;the wisest of all
men,&rsquo; gave to the servants of the king of Tyre in one-fourth
payment for their labor in preparing the temple which he built to the
Lord, was probably especially blessed by the Lord for that use, and so
rendered non-intoxicating, else we must conclude that he pays those who
build houses for him in what friend St. John would call &lsquo;liquid
damnation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And inasmuch as Solomon was the wisest of all men (or God
made a mistake when he so said), and the temple was for the said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=

regards wine as a legal tender, and so I put the above passage in this
category as one in which God has sanctified the use of wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In these two verses, the author of Proverbs has more than
nullified all the good things he said in his earlier chapters, and
which I have quoted in List A. I am quite sure that where <i>they</i>
have prevented the drinking of one glass of wine or strong drink, these
passages have led to the drinking of one thousand. And this is a mild
statement of the case.</p>

7</a>: &lsquo;The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth; all the
merry-hearted do sigh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more in the long list of passages wherein it is said that
God punished his chosen people by cutting off their vintage. What God
regards as a real deprivation to lose must be good to have and to keep,
in his opinion, whatever the Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union
people may think about it. Verse 9 says: &lsquo;They shall not drink
wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink
it.&rsquo; Verse 11: &lsquo;There is a crying for wine in the streets;
all joy is darkened; the mirth of the land is gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God thus punished them by taking away their wine, on the same
principle that he punishes us by killing our children, as Christians
say that he does. Will they contend that children are inherently an
evil? They must if they follow the same line of reasoning that they do
in interpreting these texts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2027:2-3">Isa.
27&nbsp;: 2, 3</a>: &lsquo;In that day sing ye unto her, a vineyard of
red wine. I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment; lest any
hurt it, I will keep it night and day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figurative, doubtless! So is the next, but all the influence
of these passages is on the side of intemperance, necessarily, for the
simple reason that the great mass of the people will take them
literally, and for the further reason that the constant association of
wine with &lsquo;good news&rsquo; and symbols of religion familiarize
the mind with it and serve to give it something of a sacred character.
This last mentioned fact helps to explain why the church so long
opposed the modern temperance movement. But here is the passage above
indicated, <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p>&ldquo;Rev. Stevenson should suggest to the Lord that, whereas wine
is an evil thing, and the Bible a &lsquo;great text book of
morals,&rsquo; and the palladium of temperance, essential in the proper
training of our children, therefore, he, the Lord, should have clearly
shown that he meant that the enemies of his chosen people should take
from them their wine that through such deprivation they should be
better and happier. But, no! he ranks wine with corn, and registers a
mighty oath that the people shall have them both.</p>

provision of the king&rsquo;s meat, and of the wine which he drank, so
nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand
before the king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here God intends, plainly, to convey the impression that wine
is nourishing! The only way in which the Christian temperance people
can relieve him from the imputation of teaching lessons so opposite to
theirs is to enter the plea that he did not inspire the writer!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hos. 2&nbsp;: 8, 9: &lsquo;For she did not know that I gave
her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold which
they prepared for Baal. Therefore I will return and take away my corn
in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will
recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if these passages and very many of like import,
are any argument against wine, they are of equal weight in the scale
against corn, wool, and many other useful and necessary articles. The
authors of such verses, wherever found, unquestionably <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>looked upon wine as one of God&rsquo;s good
gifts to his children, but which he was compelled to sometimes deprive
them of because of their disobedience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hos. 9&nbsp;: 2: &lsquo;The floor and the wine-press shall
not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, Israel shall be punished for her transgressions by
the destruction of the fertility of the soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently the perfume of wine was pleasing unto the Lord, for
he says, in promising his blessing to the repentant people (Hos.
14&nbsp;: 7): &lsquo;They shall revive as the corn, and grow as the
wine; the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jl%201:5">Joel 1&nbsp;:
5</a>: &lsquo;Awake, ye drunkards, and howl, all ye drinkers of
wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, taken by itself, would be an unqualified condemnation
of intoxicants, but such was not the prophet&rsquo;s meaning. The verse
concludes: &lsquo;Because of the new wine, for it is cut off from your
mouths.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the vision of the prophet he sees the great evils that
have come upon his country; the palmer-worm, and the locust, and the
canker-worm have destroyed the crops. &lsquo;The meat-offering and the
drink-offering is cut off from the house of the Lord, ... the corn is
wasted, the oil languisheth,&rsquo; etc. While in the verse quoted the
drinkers are mildly requested to howl, in verse thirteen we have,
&lsquo;Gird yourselves and lament, ye priests; howl ye ministers of the
altar.&rsquo; No temperance admonition or lesson here, that is
plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jl%203:18">Joel 3&nbsp;:
18</a>: &lsquo;And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains
shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all
the rivers of Judah shall flow with water,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, again, among the great blessings to be bestowed upon
the faithful is wine in abundance. One of the facts that strikes me
most forcibly, in making such an examination as this, is the almost
universal favor with which the Hebrew prophets looked upon wine and
wine-drinking; and in prophesying the evils to come upon their people
because of their disobedience to God or their oppression of their
fellows, they rarely fail to include the cutting off of the wine
supply. This they evidently regarded as one of the greatest of
calamities. Our <i>Christian</i> temperance friends would gladly, so
they say, visit wholesale destruction upon the vineyards and barley
fields, and they seem almost to seek to convey the impression that God
made a mistake when he created grapes and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>barley. This proves
how honest they are when they say that the Bible is a temperance book.
In <a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am%205:11">Amos
5&nbsp;: 11</a>, we have another example of the above-mentioned fact in
the utterances of the prophet. Denouncing the people for their
injustice, he says: &lsquo;Ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye
shall not drink wine of them.&rsquo; In the preceding sentence he had
said: &lsquo;Ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell
in them.&rsquo; Houses were good, wine was good; but because of their
sins they should be deprived of both. There is here no argument either
direct or implied in behalf of abstinence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am%209:14">Amos 9&nbsp;:
14</a>: &lsquo;And I will bring again the captivity of my people of
Israel, and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; and
they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; they shall also
make gardens and eat the fruit of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not seem that even Mr. Stevenson would venture to
claim this verse as a Bible argument for temperance. They <i>shall</i>
drink the wine!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micah. 6&nbsp;: 15: &lsquo;Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not
reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with
oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can apparently honorable men claim that God, as revealed
in the Bible, disapproves of the use of intoxicants when he is
continually telling his chosen people that he will punish them by
destroying their corn, and their wine, and their oil; evidently taking
particular pains to impress upon them the fact that they (wine, corn,
and oil) are equally good and useful?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever uttered these words, man or god; whoever wrote them,
John or some one else one hundred or more years later, there can be no

individual is to determine for himself or herself in all things
pertaining to personal conduct and habits. &lsquo;Let every man be
fully persuaded in his own mind&rsquo; is the central idea of the
various renderings. There is no rebuke, expressed or implied, of
intemperance; there is nothing that can be tortured into a condemnation
of wine-drinking or into an approval of the principle of total
abstinence, or that of prohibition. Here was his opportunity to condemn
the drinking of wine, to speak for that which is now called temperance;
but from his lips fell no words of warning; to those gathered about him
he said nothing in favor of the great reform which Christians of
to-day, falsely assuming to speak in his name, declare finds its
sanction and inspiration, its bulwark and tower of defense, in the
Bible.</p>

3&ndash;11</a>: &lsquo;And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus
saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what
have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith
unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. And there were
set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of
the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto
them, Fill the water-pots with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367"
href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>water. And they filled them
up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the
governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast
had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was
(but the servants which drew the water knew), the governor of the feast
called the bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning
doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which
is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now. This beginning of
miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory;
and his disciples believed on him.&rsquo;</p>

46</a>: &lsquo;So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made
the water wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first miracle which Jesus performed was to convert six
pots of water into wine! And this feat convinced his disciples of his
supernatural origin and powers! And he did this to manifest forth his
glory! Either this is true or the Bible is false. Whether true or not,
it has been a most powerful argument against abstinence; it has
resulted directly in making drunkards, as it has indirectly in making
hypocrites and Jesuitical sophists. I of course mean by this last
sentence that the seeming necessity to prove the Bible a temperance
work has made any number of Christian apologists resort to all kinds of
specious arguments and make any number of false claims in order to make
good their assertions. The assumption that this wine was not of an
intoxicating nature is purely gratuitous. There is not even the ghost
of a fact to be found in support of it. Hundreds of passages, which I
have quoted under their appropriate heads, prove beyond a doubt that
the wine so often mentioned in the Bible was intoxicating; the words of
the governor prove that this miraculously produced portion of it
certainly was of the very best, for it is against all reason to suppose
that men accustomed to the taste and effects of wine would pronounce
simple grape-juice to be better than all that had already been served
to them at the feast; and, finally, the declaration that this act of
Jesus was a miracle and that it made his disciples to &lsquo;believe on
him,&rsquo; gives the last stroke to the already nearly dead
&lsquo;non-intoxicating&rsquo; theory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is probable that this short verse has led to the
consumption of more wine and caused more intemperance than any other
equal number of words in any language or contained in any book. It has
had more potent effect upon the mind of the Christian believer than
have twenty passages which have in a hesitating, half-hearted,
uncertain way caution against the use of <i>much</i> wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comparing this class of passages with those grouped under

voted <i>more than five to one</i> by those in favor of the use of
intoxicants. The record is an astonishingly bad one for the Bible as a
total abstinence and Prohibition work, and should put to the blush all
of its worshipers and apologists who have been so foolish or
unscrupulous as to claim that it is indispensable to the temperance

<h3 class="main">The Inconsistency of Agnosticism.</h3>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">&ldquo;It seems to me as irrational to say there is
<i>no</i> God as to say there is <i>a</i> God.&rdquo;&mdash;Editor
Twentieth Century.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;But pray, why? Does not that proposition
tacitly concede that it is irrational to say there <i>is</i> a God? If
so, how can it be irrational to deny an irrational proposition or
absurdity? Are not the two propositions antithetical? If so, one or the
other is, of necessity, false. Conceding then, as he does, the
absurdity of the God idea, why will Mr. Pentecost persist,
inconsistently, in maintaining that there is no difference between the
rationality of Theism and Materialism, with its incidental Atheism?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he kindly tell us the difference in degree of
rationality between the position that there is a personal Devil and
that there is a God? Are not both notions of the same origin and
equally absurd? Are not both transmitted to us from the dark ages, from
the same book, and must not both stand or fall together? Yet Mr.
Pentecost would not, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369"
name="pb369">369</a>]</span>from pure deference and respect for our
poor, non-evolved pious friends, assume an Agnostic&rsquo;s attitude
and concede that &lsquo;it is as irrational to say there is no Devil as
to say there is a Devil.&rsquo; Of course not. He simply denies the
existence of His Satanic Majesty without equivocation, and the proof of
his existence not being forthcoming his denial is equivalent to proof
that such a being does not exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In law and equity the affirmative is obliged to prove its
case. If then a proposition is self-evidently absurd, unnatural and
absolutely impossible, why concede to those affirming, without a shadow
of proof, that their belief is equally rational with our unbelief, that
&lsquo;it may be so,&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having discarded as authoritative ancient traditions, there
is absolutely no logic, no reason, no science, no analogy that will
sustain or demonstrate the existence of a God. And in view of this fact
a simple denial is all-sufficient to prove the negative. As the plea of
the prisoner at the bar of &lsquo;not guilty&rsquo; is equivalent to
proof of his innocence and bound to be respected by court and juror,
unless, indeed, the affirmative, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
establishes his guilt, so the Atheist&rsquo;s fearless denial,
nowadays, must demand profound respect, and is equivalent to proof,
unless, indeed, the Church brings proof, outside of a discarded Bible,
of the truth of its basic idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, though unnecessary to prove a negative, and the God-idea
not having been established by history, revelation, science, or reason,
yet alleged arguments being continually advanced in the vain endeavor
to resuscitate a vanishing religion, a few propositions are here
advanced <i>which prove there is no God</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a universe. This proves there is <i>no</i> God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The universe is infinite. This excludes anything else of like
character&mdash;two infinities being an absurdity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The universe (nature) is here and there and everywhere. This
proves that God cannot be here and there and everywhere. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time.
Matter (implying energy and force) monopolizing every point of space,
nothing else can occupy it in addition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The universe exists now. Something cannot come from nothing,
therefore the universe has always existed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being eternal and infinite, this excludes anything anterior,
exterior, or superior to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is God in the universe or the universe in God? If there is a
God, either of these propositions must be true, yet both are glaringly
absurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can an engineer drive a locomotive and be a locomotive at the
same time? If not, how can a God manipulate an infinite universe and be
infinite &lsquo;Himself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the universe, <i>outside of a God</i>, is an absolute
reality, as much so as a locomotive is a reality outside of the
engineer. The world is a reality, our planets, the sun, all the
countless millions of stars within reach of our telescopes and the
infinitude of stars and systems beyond the reach of our strongest
lenses, which science infers to exist, all these are a reality and all
these, yes, every object of knowledge is a reality, and all these are
<i>not God</i>! How then, in the name of reason I ask, can a God, of
whom we know absolutely nothing, be infinite, when an infinite number
of material objects&mdash;not God&mdash;fill all space?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does the universe exist <i>in God</i>? If we but imagine
for a moment the aspect of the universe to resemble a huge machine of
infinite proportions, eternally active in all its vast proportions, the
idea of the universe existing within a God will appear equally childish
and simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All phenomena are the results of energy co-existent and
inseparable from matter. All cosmic motion, change, and life may be
traced to this physical and chemical energy pervading all
nature&mdash;<i>never to a God</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind&mdash;the so-called infinite as well as
finite&mdash;implies limit, localization, conditions, etc. This fact
tends to prove that while God, perchance, might concentrate his mind on
the world or some particular sect or individual, considering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>their exhortations, the rest of the world and
the universe for the time being would be Godless!</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a late scientific authority I quote in proof:
<span class="corr" id="xd21e11773" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>It is impossible for a person&rsquo;s
mind to be in two places at the same time.&rsquo; Noted chess players
may play twenty games simultaneously, but it is done by speedy transfer
of thoughts from one game to another and not by considering two moves
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus &lsquo;Omniscience&rsquo; is impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again; mind implies limit and necessitates organism, brain,
nervous force, etc. This again makes impossible a God. Let the Church
demonstrate <i>how a God without a brain can be a God and all it
implies, or how a God with a brain can be infinite</i>, and I will
kneel down and worship with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this dogmatism? The &lsquo;dogmatism of the Infidel&rsquo;
we hear so much about? If it is, then asserting that twice two is four
is dogmatism. Then we state all the facts of mathematics, all the
truths of history is dogmatism. We simply confine ourselves to fact, to
knowledge and demonstrated truth. There we stop and refuse to accept
the crude notions transmitted from our ignorant ancestors, which, it is
dogmatically asserted, are true in spite of our knowledge and
reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest against being accused of dogmatism, I studiously
endeavor to be fair and make no pretensions to scholarship and
learning. But I emphatically protest against the dogmatism of others
who, assuming a superior air of knowledge assert notions contrary to
fact. Supposing some one should affirm that twice two is five, would it
be dogmatism, to deny the proposition, and would thinking minds be
justified to assume the attitude of Agnostics and concede that while in
their opinion twice two is four, yet twice two may be five, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; &lsquo;one proposition is as irrational as the
other,&rsquo; etc.?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>know</i> a universe exists. Existing now proves it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>is eternal. This simple fact absolutely makes
impossible, yes, needless, a God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply assert that twice two is four and cannot possibly be
five. That the universe filling all space nothing else can fill it in
addition. If this be dogmatism all knowledge is a
farce.&rdquo;&mdash;Wettstein.</p>

whatever has occurred and will occur, and for all the suffering in the
world, since he had full power to prevent it but did not, and does not;
and the conclusion to be drawn from this fact is, that he intended all
things to be just as they have been in the past, are now and are to be

the belief in God is one of the things that is helping very strongly to

things that is preventing the people from thinking for themselves and
helping themselves. The human mind will never be perfectly free, and

And general wealth must be achieved, not because it is God&rsquo;s will

<p>2. Then this something was eternal, and hence self-existent.</p>
<p>3. Since self-existent and eternal, it must have been infinite, and
hence was everything existing everywhere.</p>
<p>4. Therefore, all that is, has always been; that is,
<i>everything</i> has eternally existed <i>everywhere</i>.</p>
<p>But will you say that this something, this self-existent, eternal
everything, is God? Very well. Then nothing but God could be. Then he
must be the <i>all</i> of everything existing <i>everywhere</i>. Then
where is your universe? You see you cannot have a universe if you have
a God. We have the universe; hence you cannot have a God. &ldquo;But he
<i>created</i> the universe,&rdquo; you say. Very well; from what did
he create it? <i>Nothing?</i> Omnipresent God alone extending on, and
on, and forever on through all the <i>everywheres</i>, cramming all the
immensities full of his essential self. He could not have created the
universe beyond himself, since there was <i>no</i> beyond. There could
have been no place in which to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375"
href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>put it outside of himself
when created, since there was no <i>outside</i>. If created, it must
have been from his own essence; and then it would not have been a
<i>creation</i> of anything, but a changing of himself into something
different; and that was not possible, since he was self-existent, and
must necessarily exist the same forever, since he was eternal, and must
exist unchangeable. So the universe could not have been made from
nothing, since all the spaces <i>everywhere</i> were crammed completely
full of <i>everything</i>, and hence there was no unoccupied premises
where the raw material could have been stored away. It could not have
been <i>created</i> from God-substance, since that already was; it
could not have been <i>formed</i> from God&rsquo;s pre-existing self,
since that would have been to change the eternally unchangeable into
something else&mdash;to annihilate himself as God by working himself
over into the universe. You see that there can be but one Eternal All.
You cannot have both&mdash;a God and the universe. And since we have
the universe, that is, everything eternally existing everywhere, we
need no God, there is no room for a God, and there has never been
anything for a God to do. Therefore, there <i>is</i> no God.</p>
<p>As an infinite God must necessarily fill the entirety of space,
there could be no room for aught else. God and man could not live
together in the same universe. God would necessarily be
<i>everything</i>; then the universe must be <i>nothing</i>. But we
<i>have</i> the universe, and that is everything; therefore God is
<i>nothing</i>&mdash;existing nowhere. A mote that <i>is</i>, is better
than a God that is not. If we part with God and obtain a universe, we
make a magnificent exchange. The issue has always been God versus
matter. When people come to understand that matter has <i>always</i>
been, that it eternally had the start of everything else, and hence
needed no creation, it will be seen that there never has been any
necessity for a God, and as the universe is ever governed by law, there
is nothing for a God to do. Men must believe in matter, because it is
everything, and does everything. <i>Something</i> <span class=

men. He must have justice established between man and man. The toiler
must get the fruits of his toil. A good home has a more sacred
influence over the hearts of men to make them kind and good, than all
the preaching in the world. With a home of his own man has a little
heaven of his own, and a truer and better love of his neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The character of a god is the character of the people who
have made him. When therefore I expose the crimes of Jehovah, I expose
the defective morality of Israel; and when I criticise the God of
modern Europe, I criticise the defective <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>intellects of
Europeans. The reader must endeavor to bear this in mind; for though he
may think that his idea of the Creator is actually the Creator, that
belief is not shared by me.&rdquo; (Winwood Reade, &ldquo;Martyrdom of
Man.&rdquo;)</p>

<h3 class="main">ATONEMENT.</h3>
<h3 class="main">Atonement for Sin, an Immoral Doctrine.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. The doctrine of the atonement is of heathen origin,
and is predicated upon the assumption that no sin can be fully expiated
without the shedding of blood. In the language of Paul, &ldquo;Without
the shedding of blood there can be no remission of sin.&rdquo; A
barbarous and bloody doctrine truly! But this doctrine was almost
universally prevalent amongst the orientals long before Paul&rsquo;s
time.</p>
<p>2. Christians predicate the dogma of atonement for sin upon the
assumption that Christ&rsquo;s death and sufferings were a substitute
for Adam&rsquo;s death, incurred by the fall. But as Adam&rsquo;s
sentence was death, and he suffered that penalty, this assumption
cannot be true.</p>
<p>3. If the penalty for sin was death, as taught in <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203">Genesis 3</a>, and
Christ suffered that penalty for man, then man should not die; but, as
he does, it makes the doctrine preposterous. It could not have meant
spiritual death, as some argue, because a part of the penalty was that
of being doomed to return to dust (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203:19">Gen. 3&nbsp;:
19</a>).</p>
<p>4. If crucifixion was indispensably necessary as a penalty, then the
punishment should have been inflicted either upon the instigator or
perpetrator of the deed; either the serpent or Adam should have been
nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>5. We are told in reply, that as an infinite sin was committed, it
required an infinite sacrifice. But Adam, being a finite being, could
not commit an infinite sin; and Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice and sufferings
could not be infinite unless he had continued to suffer to all
eternity<span class="corr" id="xd21e11955" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Therefore the assumption is false.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. An all-wise God would not let things get into such a condition as
to require the murder of his only son from any consideration
whatever.</p>
<p>7. And no father, cherishing a proper regard and love for his son,
could have required him to be, or consented to have him put to death in
a cruel manner; for the claims of mercy and paternal affection are as
imperative as justice.</p>
<p>8. To put an intelligent and innocent being to death, for any
purpose is a violation of the moral law, and as great a sin as that for
which he died. Hecatombs of victims cannot atone for the infraction of
the moral law which is engraven upon our souls.</p>
<p>9. If it were necessary for Christ to be put to death, then Judas is
entitled to one half the merit of it for inaugurating the act, as it
could not have taken place without his aid; and no one who took part in
it should be censured, but praised.</p>
<p>10. It is evident, that, if everybody had been Quakers no atonement
would have been made, as their religion is opposed to bloodshed.</p>
<p>11. The atonement is either one God putting another to death or God
putting himself to death to appease his own wrath; but both assumptions
are monstrous absurdities, which no person distinguished for science or
reason can indorse.</p>
<p>12. Anger and murder are the two principal features in the doctrine
of the atonement; and both are repugnant to our moral sense and
feelings of refinement, and indicate a barbarous and heathen
origin.</p>
<p>13. The atonement punishes the innocent for the guilty, which is a
twofold crime, and a reversal of the spirit of justice. If a father
should catch four of his children stealing and the fifth one standing
by and remonstrating against the act, and should seize on the innocent
one and administer a severe flagellation, he would commit a double
crime: 1st, that of punishing an innocent child; 2d, that of
exonerating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>and encouraging the four children in the
commission of crime. The atonement involves the same principle.</p>
<p>14. No person with true moral manhood would consent to be be saved
on any such terms; but would prefer to suffer for his own sins, rather
than let an innocent being suffer for them. And the man who would
accept salvation upon such terms must be a sneak and a coward, with a
soul not worth saving.</p>
<p>15. Who that possesses any sense of justice would want to swim
through blood to get to the heavenly mansion. I want neither animals,
men, nor Gods murdered to save my soul.</p>
<p>16. If there is any virtue in the atonement in the way of expiating
crime, then there is now another atonement demanded by the principles
of moral justice to cancel the sin committed by the first
atonement&mdash;that of murdering an innocent being, &ldquo;in whose
mouth was no guile;&rdquo; and then another atonement to wipe out the
sin of this atonement, and so on. And thus it would be atonement after
atonement, murder after murder, <i>ad infinitum</i>. What shocking
consequences and absurdities are involved in this ancient heathen
superstition!</p>
<p>17. It seems strange that any person can cherish the thought for a
moment that the Infinite Father would <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e11989" title="Source: requre">require</span> a sacrificial
offering for the trifling act of eating a little fruit, and require no
atonement for the infinitely greater sin of murdering &ldquo;his only
begotten son.&rdquo; Another monstrous absurdity!</p>
<p>18. The advocates of the atonement tell us that man stands toward
his Creator in the relation of a debtor, and the atonement cancels the
debt. To be sure! How does it do it?&mdash;Graves.</p>

<h3 class="main">A MINORITY NOT A SECT.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;A Protestant minister of Oakland, California,
in a recent address on the public school system of the United
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>States, expressed himself as follows: &lsquo;In
one of the schools of San Francisco Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s
<span class="corr" id="xd21e12003" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Data of Ethics<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e12006" title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> was introduced as a
text book of morals&mdash;as palpable a violation of the law forbidding
sectarian instruction as the introduction of the Catholic or Methodist
catechism; for Hebert Spencer belongs to a very small and narrow sect
which promulgates the creed of Agnosticism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the reverend speaker had taken the ground that the
&lsquo;Data of Ethics&rsquo; was too abstruse to be placed in the hands
of public school pupils we should have felt inclined to sustain his
objection. But when he says that to introduce such a book is to give a
sectarian character to the school in which it is used, we must enter a
protest. Science is never sectarian; philosophy is never sectarian.
Sectarian teaching begins when you ask a man or a child to assume what
cannot be proved, for the sake of keeping within the dogmatic lines
that fence round some particular creed. The followers of Mr. Spencer
may be in a minority, but they are no more a sect than were the
adherents of the Copernican system of astronomy, or than are the
believers in the Darwinian theory of natural selection. Mr. Spencer
makes no appeal to faith, but finds his premises in the common
experience of mankind. A pupil who was being taught out of the
&lsquo;Data of Ethics&rsquo; would be quite at liberty to dispute
either the premises or the arguments of the author; and he would not be
silenced by the declaration that Mr. Spencer is infallible. But when
catechisms are taught they are taught, not as containing matter for
discussion, but as containing doctrines that must not be disputed, on
pain of more or less disagreeable consequences. Similarly when the
Bible is read in school it is read not as a fallible record of events,
or a fallible guide in morals, but as something absolutely
authoritative&mdash;the very voice of God. It is perfectly obvious
then, where sectarianism in education begins; it begins just at the
point where doctrines of any kind accepted on faith by a portion of the
community and not discussible on grounds of reason, are made a part of
public school instruction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=
"#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>Sectarianism comes in whenever the
teacher is obliged to say, &lsquo;Hush&rsquo; to the inquiring scholar
who wants his reason satisfied before he will believe. There is no
sectarianism, on the other hand, in making use of a book which lays no
claim to any kind of privilege, and which, therefore, cannot force the
belief of anyone. The followers of Mr. Spencer do not form a sect
because they have no beliefs which they wish to exempt from criticism
or discussion, and because they hold themselves at full liberty to pass
beyond the bounds of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s thought whenever they can see
their way to doing so. Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Data of Ethics&rsquo;
may not contain all the truth on the subject of morals, but the truth
which it does contain lends itself to demonstration; and no one can be
the worse for being taught demonstrable truths. Upon that foundation he
can afterward build what he likes&mdash;hay, stubble, or what not; and
after his superstructure has been tried by the fire of experience, as
it is very likely to be, he will still have something solid left on
which to rebuild in perchance wiser fashion. We do not advocate the
introduction of the &lsquo;Data of Ethics&rsquo; into the public
schools: but we are convinced that it would be a very good thing for
the rising generation if some of the ideas contained in that book could
be brought home to their minds.<span class="corr" id="xd21e12013"
